Why do we have to physically create new elements in order to put it on the periodic table? Can't we already predict everything about an element before we even see it?,"['informational', 'complex', 'technical', 'science', 'question', 'explanation', 'research', 'non-sensitive']","[{'raw_text': 'One hundred fifty years after Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published his system for neatly arranging the elements, the periodic table it gave birth to hangs in every chemistry classroom in the world and is one of the field’s most recognizable symbols. But the solid squares and familiar patterns of today’s table mask one of its fundamental characteristics: “the” periodic table does not exist.It’s been mutable from the beginning. Not only has it grown as new elements have been discovered; it has also added columns and changed shape as we’ve gained new understanding of the elements’ properties and their relationships to one another. And scientists are still debating its optimum configuration.Some believe chemical properties should dictate how the elements line up on the periodic table. Others think a more fundamental principle is needed, like electronic configuration or simply atomic number. Partisans are clashing over which elements belong in group 3, where helium should go, and how many columns the periodic table should have. They follow a long line of chemists and physicists who have worked and reworked the elements into a semblance of order.“What I find interesting about the current debate is there are people who insist on there being one right table,” says Michael D. Gordin, a Princeton University historian who has written about Mendeleev, Julius Lothar Meyer, and other creators of early periodic tables. “It would have struck people like Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer as weird.” Gordin says the periodic table pioneers understood their tables to be a reflection of natural laws but recognized that different tables could represent those laws in different ways. That might be hard to imagine for those of us used to seeing the familiar shape of the table on our coffee mug or shower curtain.Setting the tableMendeleev wasn’t the first to recognize patterns in the elements, nor was he the first to try to depict those patterns in a diagram. Chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, for instance, identified triads of elements with shared properties in 1829. Today we’d recognize these as members of the same group or column of the periodic table, like chlorine, bromine, and iodine.Geologist Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois published a kind of periodic table in 1862 in which the elements spiraled up a cylinder according to atomic weight. Each column of elements shared properties.Mendeleev published his table, which he called a “periodic system,” in 1869. It included all 56 elements then known, and if you squint, it has a somewhat similar shape to the periodic table we see today, only tipped 90° on its side. Mendeleev arranged the elements in order of increasing weight and broke them into rows such that elements in each column shared valence, the number of other atoms they combined with, as well as other properties.What made Mendeleev’s table special was his recognition that the periodic system was strong enough to predict undiscovered elements, which he left holes for, and even their properties. Lothar Meyer was independently working on an almost identical table, but Mendeleev beat him to publication by a few months and secured his place in history.One can trace today’s controversies over how the periodic table should look to the discovery of quantum mechanics and atomic numbers. Mendeleev ostensibly organized his table by increasing atomic weight, but he gave chemical properties a deciding vote. For example, tellurium is slightly heavier than iodine, but Mendeleev put tellurium first because it has the same valence as oxygen, sulfur, and other elements in its group. Tables have retained that ordering. Mendeleev didn’t know that tellurium has one fewer proton—and thus is one atomic number less—than iodine, which explains why they each belong where they do. “When you get atomic number, it provides logic” to the periodic table, Gordin says.Along with protons came the discovery of electrons and the quantum-mechanical idea of atomic orbitals. These findings provided a whole new kind of logic for the periodic system. Although the organization of Mendeleev’s system didn’t change, scientists could now see that it was electronic structure that largely dictated elements’ properties and explained why members of the same group were similar. The Madelung rule, or aufbau principle, that dictates that electrons fill the 1s orbital first and then the 2s and the 2p and so on, further explained how the elements were ordered.That brings us to the tables we see today, which don’t look that different from the versions famed chemist Glenn T. Seaborg drew in the 1940s. Seaborg moved the f-block elements—also called the lanthanide and actinide series—out of the main table to leave them floating below. This decision is generally understood as a concession to convenience; if those elements were in line with the others, the table would be too wide to fit on a standard sheet of paper or the type would be too small to read.Seaborg included 15 elements in his f-block. That doesn’t make a lot of sense from an electronic configuration point of view, since the f orbitals hold only 14 electrons. But many tables—including the table on the website of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), which has the last word on naming elements and molecules—share this feature. It’s a way of avoiding one of the most controversial questions about the periodic table: What elements belong in group 3? No one disputes scandium and yttrium. But which elements come below those two? Lanthanum and actinium? Or lutetium and lawrencium?Group decisionToday there’s no standardization in the periodic tables found in classrooms, labs, and textbooks. Some avoid the group 3 question and use a 15-element f-block. Others put La and Ac in group 3, and still others have Lu and Lr, with the remainder of the f-block floating below.IUPAC has convened a working group to make a definitive recommendation one way or the other. One motivation for forming the task group, according to IUPAC’s website, is to clear up confusion among students and teachers about which table is correct.Philip Ball, a science writer and member of the working group, says the debate comes down to a fundamental question of whether physics or chemistry shapes the table. Put another way, he says the group is debating whether to side with the quantum physics that determines elements’ electronic configurations or with the way elements behave chemically.On the side of chemical behavior is Guillermo Restrepo, a mathematical chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences. Restrepo takes a historical view of how the table should be organized. He points to Mendeleev and his contemporaries, who found their periodic systems by studying elements’ properties, often through their binding behavior. “At the core of the periodic system, what you have is chemistry,” Restrepo says, “and you need chemical reactions.”Restrepo and colleagues analyzed some 4,700 binary compounds containing 94 elements to determine how chemical reactions inform the periodic system (MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem.2012, 68,417). The molecules could consist of more than one atom but only two elements. The researchers created a map that groups elements near those that form similar compounds. For example, fluorine, chlorine, and the other halogens sit next to each other because they all bind to similar elements.Restrepo says this similarity landscape shows that lanthanum is more similar to scandium and yttrium than lutetium is, so it should be in group 3. But the analysis doesn’t provide a good answer about Lr versus Ac. Restrepo says the problem is there isn’t much data on how Lr and Ac bind to other entities. While there are tens of thousands of compounds one can use to study the similarities of Sc, Y, La, and Lu, Ac provides only about 70 data points, and Lr, fewer than 40, according to Restrepo.Eric Scerri, a philosopher of science at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the chair of the IUPAC task group, disagrees. He believes Sc, Y, Lu, and Lr should be the group 3 elements. Scerri thinks a focus on chemical or physical properties is misguided. He compares it to early botanists’ classification of flowers by their color or petal number.“You’ve got to go for something fundamental,” Scerri says, like electronic configuration. “Just to amass properties is never going to give you a definitive answer.”Not that electronic configuration is perfect either, as Scerri will tell you. Exceptions have been made for some elements in the periodic table in terms of how their orbitals are filled, like copper. By the periodic table’s logic, all d-block elements should have filled s orbitals. But copper defies that logic. It should have the electron configuration [Ar] 3d9 4s2. Instead, its 4s atomic orbital remains unfilled, and one electron goes in its 3d shell, leading to the configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s1, which is more stable.Scerri does prefer electronic configuration to what he calls “gross physical characteristics” for organizing the table. But he sees an even simpler logic to solve the group 3 problem: arrange by atomic number. If Scerri has his way, we’ll all have to get used to a newly arranged table.Going wide“My suggestion is simply this,” Scerri says. “Represent the periodic table in a 32-column format.”Scerri calls 32 columns a more natural form for the periodic table and attributes the current dominance of 18 columns to convenience only. A 32-column table uses the atomic numbers as its logical foundation. Not only would it solve the group 3 question, but Scerri says 32 columns would be more correct because it puts the f-block in its rightful place: inside the table rather than floating below for convenience.In a 32-column table arranged by ascending atomic number, lanthanum (atomic number 57) follows barium (number 56) to start the f-block, with actinium below it. That makes lutetium the first element in the third row of the d-block, with scandium and yttrium above it and lawrencium below to form group 3. Strict adherence to atomic number satisfies Scerri’s desire for a fundamental organizing principle and neatly sidesteps questions about chemical or physical properties.Another table similar to the 32-column version has been proposed, but it uses electronic configuration rather than atomic numbers as its primary guide. French scientist Charles Janet’s left-step periodic table, devised in 1928, isn’t likely to make it into textbooks anytime soon, however. Janet moves the s-block to the right side of the table and includes helium at the top of group 2 because its s orbital, like other elements in that group, is filled.Most tables place helium atop the noble gases. Scerri thinks helium’s demotion in the left-step table is one reason the table never got more traction, though recent experiments showing helium can form stable bonds help Janet’s argument that it belongs in a group with other reactive, rather than inert, elements.Regardless, read from top to bottom and left to right, the left-step table more correctly conforms to the Madelung rule, which states that electrons must first fill the lowest-available electron levels before filling higher ones, Scerri says. It has a regularity that current tables don’t: two periods of 2 elements, two of 8 elements, two of 18, two of 32. And when element 121 is discovered, it will begin the g-block and two new periods of 50 elements.Relative difficultyThe filling order that most chemists are used to might not hold up for much longer, however. Some calculations show the Madelung rule breaks down at higher atomic numbers because of relativistic effects. Electrons in large atoms move so fast that their behavior—and the properties of the atoms they belong to—begin to change.Fans of relativistic effects will be happy to know there’s a table for them too. Pekka Pyykkö, a theoretical chemist at the University of Helsinki, calculated electron configurations up to element 172 and made a table for them (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2010, DOI: 10.1039/c0cp01575j). Pyykkö doesn’t bother with the group 3 question. His table leaves a hole under yttrium and has three 15-element rows in an f-block floating beneath the main table. Nor is he so constrained by atomic numbers. For instance, element 164 is followed by elements 139, 140, and then 169. According to Pyykkö’s calculations, 139 and 140 are the first elements with electrons in the 8p orbital.This table is, of course, largely hypothetical. Scientists have not yet synthesized any elements beyond 118, and while several groups are working to do so, it’s possible we will reach the limits of our abilities to forge new elements well before element 172 or even 139.“This is open land,” says Peter Schwerdtfeger, a theoretical chemist at Massey University studying superheavy elements. He calls Pyykkö’s calculations a “very good approximation” of the electron configurations but says more calculations are needed to pin down the precise characteristics of these elements. Pyykkö agrees. He too is waiting for more detailed calculations to show how wrong or right his table is.And there are still other configurations of the elements that scientists are arguing for. Some tables look like rings or spirals. Some are 3-D, with lobes or stacks of element blocks. It seems less likely any of these will challenge the basic shape of the current table.But Restrepo encourages scientists to think beyond just one table. “There’s a lot of discussion about if this table is good or bad, if this shape is better or worse,” he says. He prefers to focus on the periodic system rather than on the table. In a sense, he says, the system is like a sculpture, and the tables are shadows cast by lights shone from different angles. He says that allows chemists to find the periodic table or tables that are most useful to them, whether they’re looking for new elements or trying to understand properties in detail.Gordin agrees on historical grounds. The periodic tables of the 19th century, he says, were made “to be flexible.” But he understands the resistance to radically different periodic tables, comparing new periodic tables to Pluto’s demotion from the ranks of planets. “The table you grew up with is the table you like.”That raises a question about how much scientists and others should worry about these debates. “There’s a little group that argues over which [periodic table] is best,” Ball says. He believes the IUPAC group’s work is important because the current situation, with several competing tables, is confusing. But Ball says there’s no reason to think one table can capture the whole picture. “This notion of periodicity was so important for chemistry when the periodic table was first put forward and in the subsequent decades to make sense of this chaos of elements,” he says.But today it should be more of a rule of thumb rather than a law of nature, Ball adds, arguing that there’s room for more than one periodic table: “Chemistry is about compromise.”This story was updated on Jan. 8, 2019, to correct the left-step periodic table. Its s-block was aligned incorrectly.Join the conversationContact the reporterSubmit a Letter to the Editor for publicationEngage with us on Twitter', 'url': 'https://cen.acs.org/physical-chemistry/periodic-table/periodic-table-icon-chemists-still/97/i1', 'cleaned_text': 'One hundred fifty years after Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published his system for neatly arranging the elements, the periodic table it gave birth to hangs in every chemistry classroom in the world and is one of the field’s most recognizable symbols.

The earliest attempt to classify the elements was in 1789, when Antoine Lavoisier grouped the elements based on their properties into gases, non-metals, metals and earths. Several other attempts were made to group elements together over the coming decades. In 1829, Johann Döbereiner recognised triads of elements with chemically similar properties, such as lithium, sodium and potassium, and showed that the properties of the middle element could be predicted from the properties of the other two.It was not until a more accurate list of the atomic mass of the elements became available at a conference in Karlsruhe, Germany in 1860 that real progress was made towards the discovery of the modern periodic table.This area of the website celebrates the work of many famous scientists whose quest to learn more about the world we live in and the atoms that make up the things around us led to the periodic table as we know it today.Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de ChancourtoisAlexandre-Emile Béguyer de ChancourtoisCan France claim the first periodic table? Probably not, but a French Geology Professor made a significant advance towards it, even though at the time few people were aware of it.Alexandre Béguyer de Chancourtois was a geologist, but this was at a time when scientists specialised much less than they do today. His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.The telluric screw plotted the atomic weights of the elements on the outside of a cylinder, so that one complete turn corresponded to an atomic weight increase of 16. As the diagram shows, this arrangement means that certain elements with similar properties appear in a vertical line. Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights.The vis tellurique from De Chancourtois’s original publication (right) and a copy drawn out with modern symbols (left).John NewlandsJohn NewlandsJohn Newlands was British; his father was a Scottish Presbyterian minister. He was educated by his father at home, and then studied for a year (1856) at the Royal College of Chemistry, which is now part of Imperial College London. Later he worked at an agricultural college trying to find patterns of behaviour in organic chemistry. However, he is remembered for his search for a pattern in inorganic chemistry.Just four years before Mendeleev announced his periodic table, Newlands noticed that there were similarities between elements with atomic weights that differed by seven. He called this The Law of Octaves, drawing a comparison with the octaves of music. The noble gases (Helium, Neon, Argon etc.) were not discovered until much later, which explains why there was a periodicity of 7 and not 8 in Newlands table. Newlands did not leave any gaps for undiscovered elements in his table, and sometimes had to cram two elements into one box in order to keep the pattern. Because of this, the Chemical Society refused to publish his paper, with one Professor Foster saying he might have equally well listed the elements alphabetically.Even when Mendeleev had published his table, and Newlands claimed to have discovered it first, the Chemical Society would not back him up. In 1884 he was asked to give a lecture of the Periodic Law by the Society, which went some way towards making amends. Finally, in 1998 the Royal Society of Chemistry oversaw the placing a blue commemorative plaque on the wall of his birthplace, recognising his discovery at last.The blue commemorative plaque placed at Newlands’ birthplace, declaring him the “discoverer of the Periodic Law for the chemical elements”.Julius Lothar MeyerJulius Lothar MeyerMeyer trained at Heidelberg University under Bunsen and Kirchhoff, as did Mendeleev. So the two scientists would certainly have known each other although neither was aware of all the work done by the other. Meyer's roots, however, were firmly in Germany. Meyer was just four years older than Mendeleev, and produced several Periodic Tables between 1864-1870.His first table contained just 28 elements, organised by their valency (how many other atoms they can combine with). These elements were almost entirely main group elements, but in 1868 he incorporated the transition metals in a much more developed table. This 1868 table listed the elements in order of atomic weight, with elements with the same valency arranged in vertical lines, strikingly similar to Mendeleev’s table. Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn’t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev’s periodic table had been published. Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other’s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.Meyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though. He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.A modern version of Meyer’s graph demonstrating the periodic trends in the atomic volume of the elements, plotted against atomic weight.Dmitri MendeleevDmitri MendeleevAs we have seen, Mendeleev was not the first to attempt to find order within the elements, but it is his attempt that was so successful that it now forms the basis of the modern periodic table.Mendeleev did not have the easiest of starts in life. He was born at Tobolsk in 1834, the youngest child of a large Siberian family. His father died while he was young, and so his mother moved the family 1500 km to St. Petersburg, where she managed to get Dmitri into a “good school“, recognising his potential. In his adult life he was a brilliant scientist, rising quickly in academic circles. He wrote a textbook, Chemical Principles, because he couldn’t find an adequate Russian book.Mendeleev discovered the periodic table (or Periodic System, as he called it) while attempting to organise the elements in February of 1869. He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred. For example, a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal. Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.Not only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered. For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.The real genius of Mendeleev’s achievement was to leave gaps for undiscovered elements. He even predicted the properties of five of these elements and their compounds. And over the next 15 years, three of these elements were discovered and Mendeleev’s predictions shown to be incredibly accurate. The table below shows the example of Gallium, which Mendeleev called eka-aluminium, because it was the element after aluminium. Scandium and Germanium were the other two elements discovered by 1886, and helped to cement the reputation of Mendeleev’s periodic table.The final triumph of Mendeleev’s work was slightly unexpected. The discovery of the noble gases during the 1890s by William Ramsay initially seemed to contradict Mendeleev’s work, until he realised that actually they were further proof of his system, fitting in as the final group on his table. This gave the table the periodicity of 8 which we know, rather than 7 as it had previously been. Mendeleev never received a Nobel Prize for his work, but element 101 was named Mendelevium after him, an even rarer distinction.Eka-aluminium (Ea)Gallium (Ga)Atomic weightAbout 6869.72Density of solid6.0 g/cm³5.9 g/cm³Melting pointLow29.78°CValency33Method of discoveryProbably from its spectrumSpectroscopicallyOxideFormula Ea2O3, density 5.5 g/cm3.

The periodic table was arranged by atomic mass, and this nearly always gives the same order as the atomic number. However, there were some exceptions (like iodine and tellurium, see above), which didn’t work. Mendeleev had seen that they needed to be swapped around, but it was Moseley that finally determined why.He fired the newly-developed X-ray gun at samples of the elements, and measured the wavelength of X-rays given. He used this to calculate the frequency and found that when the square root of this frequency was plotted against atomic number, the graph showed a perfect straight line. He’d found a way to actually measure atomic number. When the First World War broke out, Moseley turned down a position as a professor at Oxford and became an officer in the Royal Engineers. He was killed by a sniper in Turkey in August 15, and many people think that Britain lost a future Nobel prize winner.Within 10 years of his work, the structure of the atom had been determined through the work of many prominent scientists of the day, and this explained further why Moseley’s X-rays corresponded so well with atomic number. The idea behind the explanation is that when an electron falls from a higher energy level to a lower one, the energy is released as electromagnetic waves, in this case X-rays. The amount of energy that is given out depends on how strongly the electrons are attracted to the nucleus. The more protons an atom has in its nucleus, the more strongly the electrons will be attracted and the more energy will be given out. As we know, atomic number is also known as proton number, and it is the amount of protons that determine the energy of the X-rays.After years of searching, at last we had a periodic table that really worked, and the fact that we still use it today is testament to the huge achievement of these and many other great minds of the last two centuries of scientific discovery."", 'url': 'https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/history/about', 'cleaned_text': ""Table formation\nA number of other chemists before Mendeleev were investigating patterns in the properties of the elements that were known at the time.

Probably not, but a French Geology Professor made a significant advance towards it, even though at the time few people were aware of it.\n\nAlexandre Béguyer de Chancourtois was a geologist, but this was at a time when scientists specialised much less than they do today. His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.\n\nThe telluric screw plotted the atomic weights of the elements on the outside of a cylinder, so that one complete turn corresponded to an atomic weight increase of 16. As the diagram shows, this arrangement means that certain elements with similar properties appear in a vertical line. Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights.\n\nJohn Newlands\nJohn Newlands was British; his father was a Scottish Presbyterian minister. He was educated by his father at home, and then studied for a year (1856) at the Royal College of Chemistry, which is now part of Imperial College London. Later he worked at an agricultural college trying to find patterns of behaviour in organic chemistry. However, he is remembered for his search for a pattern in inorganic chemistry.\n\nJust four years before Mendeleev announced his periodic table, Newlands noticed that there were similarities between elements with atomic weights that differed by seven. He called this The Law of Octaves, drawing a comparison with the octaves of music. The noble gases (Helium, Neon, Argon etc.) were not discovered until much later, which explains why there was a periodicity of 7 and not 8 in Newlands table. Newlands did not leave any gaps for undiscovered elements in his table, and sometimes had to cram two elements into one box in order to keep the pattern. Because of this, the Chemical Society refused to publish his paper, with one Professor Foster saying he might have equally well listed the elements alphabetically.\n\nEven when Mendeleev had published his table, and Newlands claimed to have discovered it first, the Chemical Society would not back him up. In 1884 he was asked to give a lecture of the Periodic Law by the Society, which went some way towards making amends. Finally, in 1998 the Royal Society of Chemistry oversaw the placing a blue commemorative plaque on the wall of his birthplace, recognising his discovery at last.\n\nJulius Lothar Meyer\nMeyer trained at Heidelberg University under Bunsen and Kirchhoff, as did Mendeleev. So the two scientists would certainly have known each other although neither was aware of all the work done by the other. Meyer's roots, however, were firmly in Germany. Meyer was just four years older than Mendeleev, and produced several Periodic Tables between 1864-1870.\n\nHis first table contained just 28 elements, organised by their valency (how many other atoms they can combine with). These elements were almost entirely main group elements, but in 1868 he incorporated the transition metals in a much more developed table. This 1868 table listed the elements in order of atomic weight, with elements with the same valency arranged in vertical lines, strikingly similar to Mendeleev’s table. Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn’t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev’s periodic table had been published. Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other’s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.\n\nMeyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though. He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.\n\nDmitri Mendeleev\nAs we have seen, Mendeleev was not the first to attempt to find order within the elements, but it is his attempt that was so successful that it now forms the basis of the modern periodic table.\nMendeleev did not have the easiest of starts in life. He was born at Tobolsk in 1834, the youngest child of a large Siberian family. His father died while he was young, and so his mother moved the family 1500 km to St. Petersburg, where she managed to get Dmitri into a “good school“, recognising his potential. In his adult life he was a brilliant scientist, rising quickly in academic circles. He wrote a textbook, Chemical Principles, because he couldn’t find an adequate Russian book.\n\nMendeleev discovered the periodic table (or Periodic System, as he called it) while attempting to organise the elements in February of 1869. He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred. For example, a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal. Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.\n\nNot only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered. For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.\n\nThe real genius of Mendeleev’s achievement was to leave gaps for undiscovered elements. He even predicted the properties of five of these elements and their compounds. And over the next 15 years, three of these elements were discovered and Mendeleev’s predictions shown to be incredibly accurate. The table below shows the example of Gallium, which Mendeleev called eka-aluminium, because it was the element after aluminium. Scandium and Germanium were the other two elements discovered by 1886, and helped to cement the reputation of Mendeleev’s periodic table.\n\nThe final triumph of Mendeleev's achievement was the development of the modern periodic table.""}, {'raw_text': ""Explain Like I'm Five is the best forum and archive on the internet for layperson-friendly explanations.

Isn’t it fascinating that we can create something in a lab that only naturally occurs in stellar masses like stars and space clouds!Of the first 92 naturally occurring elements, Technetium (Z=43) and Promethium (61) have been produced synthetically due to their trace amounts on the Earth. They were eventually detected in distant stars, so they are categorized as naturally occurring. Elements beyond Uranium (Z=92) are completely artificial and are called trans-uranium elements.After 1913, scientists continued to add elements that they discovered in their labs and named them following the IUPAC guidelines. The first transuranic element was Neptunium (Z=93), discovered in 1940. After that, elements were added at an average of 2.5 years/element. The latest addition came in 2016 with element 118—Oganesson—named after Russian scientist Yuri Oganessian.

To create elements is like having Godly powers; you can create life or anything else that you want from them. However, these Godly powers come at a cost: energy and money.A new element can only be made from existing elements. That is how all elements came into being. The only elements in the space milieu after the Big Bang were Hydrogen (Z=1) and Helium (Z=2). Over the course of a million years, these elements’ nuclei combined in various ways to give us our known elements.Also Read: Where Did The Elements Come From?How To Make Elements ArtificiallyNew elements are primarily made through two processes: nuclear fusion and nuclear fission. Fission is used less for creating elements with a large atomic number (Z), because to create these elements, one would need an element with an even larger atomic number, which doesn’t necessarily exist in the universe, so far as we know.Fusion implies simulating the star’s core in a lab, which is next to impossible. One must generate tremendous pressure of about 265 billion bars to overcome internuclear repulsion and fuse nuclei. Instead, scientists accelerate particles at a fraction of the speed of light and bombard these elements into one another. The collisions generate enough power to overcome the fundamental repulsion.Cyclotron and Particle accelerators (atom smashers) are built for precisely this purpose. These are heavy experimental setups spread over acres of land in secluded places. Clearly, making new elements is an energy-intensive and costly process.Even if the bombardment is successful, there isn’t a guarantee that you have created a new element.The nuclide is stable if it has the right balance of protons and neutrons, known as the magic number (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 protons and 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126 neutrons.). If it is unstable, it will undergo alpha decay, beta decay, or fission. Only beta decay gives rise to new elements. This decay can take milliseconds, or years, at which point scientists verify with many analytical techniques to see if a new element has truly been formed.What Are The Criteria For An Element To Be Added?Simply discovering a new element is only half of the job. After scientists claim to have discovered an element, the JWP (Joint Working Group) of IUPAC and IUPAP stringently verifies the discovery with each of its following guidelines.- The element should be discovered through experimental demonstration only and have an atomic number that is not present in the periodic table.- It should exist for at least 10-14 seconds- The technique used to produce the new element should be reproducible; another technique like this one should bring about the new element in a different laboratory. (There are exceptions to this rule. Interested readers can refer to this paper)- The experiment giving the new element should have two aspects; the first establishes the physical and chemical properties of the sample containing the suspected new element. This is called characterization properties.- The second aspect uses properties to demonstrate that the characterization properties are indeed of the unknown element. These are called assignment properties.- Assignment of A (atomic mass number) can influence the assignment of Z; however, the priority with respect to discovery cannot be denied if the wrong A-assignment does not influence Z.Since any new element is a matter of groundbreaking discovery, the committee must review each criterion in more detail in the above paper. After the discovery of an element, naming the element is another long process.

They also understand the cost and energy that go into making elements. An even more challenging question is whether these elements are useful. The answer to that is a little nuanced.Scientists have accepted that discovering new elements is time-consuming, chance-driven, and technologically tough. You are either successful or not; even if you create a new element, you probably won’t get a stable nuclide. As a result, most of the latest research is driven towards understating the chemical properties of the existing superheavy elements (Z>100), generating their stable isotopes, and making known heavy elements.When it comes to potential applications, that answer can only be given after intensely studying each new element’s properties. Since stars are the factories of making elements, one could say that heavier elements could have been formed in distant galaxies. However, they haven’t been detected to date, and they might have vanished, even if they did exist, due to their short half-lives.Also Read: Why Do Elements Exist If They Have Such Short Half-lives?ConclusionAdding a new element to the modern periodic table has its own set of challenges. One might even question the validity of the process.

The as-yet unnamed elements 113, 115, 117 and 118 filled in the remaining gaps at the bottom of the famous chart—a roadmap of matter’s building blocks that has successfully guided chemists for nearly a century and a half.The official confirmation, granted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), was years in the making, as these superheavy elements are highly unstable and tough to create. But scientists had strong reason to believe they existed, in part because the periodic table has been remarkably consistent so far. Efforts to conjure up elements 119 and 120, which would start a new row, are already underway.But exactly how many more elements are out there remains one of chemistry’s most persistent mysteries, especially as our modern understanding of physics has revealed anomalies even in the established players.“Cracks are beginning to show in the periodic table,” says Walter Loveland, a chemist at Oregon State University.The modern incarnation of the periodic table organizes elements by rows based on atomic number—the number of protons in an atom\'s nucleus—and by columns based on the orbits of their outermost electrons, which in turn usually dictate their personalities. Soft metals that tend to react strongly with others, such as lithium and potassium, live in one column. Non-metallic reactive elements, like fluorine and iodine, inhabit another.French geologist Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois was the first person to recognize that elements could be grouped in recurring patterns. He displayed the elements known in 1862, ordered by their weights, as a spiral wrapped around a cylinder (see the illustration below). Elements vertically in line with each other on this cylinder had similar characteristics.But it was the organizational scheme created by Dmitri Mendeleev, a hot-tempered Russian who claimed to have seen groupings of elements in a dream, that stood the test of time. His 1871 periodic table wasn’t perfect; it predicted eight elements that do not exist, for instance. However, it also correctly foretold gallium (now used in lasers), germanium (now used in transistors) and other increasingly heavy elements.The Mendeleev periodic table easily accepted a brand new column for the noble gases, such as helium, which had eluded detection until the end of the 19th century because of their proclivity to not react with other elements.The modern periodic table has been more or less consistent with quantum physics, introduced in the 20th century to explain the behavior of subatomic particles like protons and electrons. In addition, the groupings have mostly held as heavier elements have been confirmed. Bohrium, the name given to element 107 after its discovery in 1981, fits so neatly with the other so-called transition metals that surround it, one of the researchers who discovered it proclaimed “bohrium is boring.”But interesting times may lie ahead.One open question concerns lanthanum and actinium, which have less in common with the other members of their respective groups than lutetium and lawrencium. IUPAC recently appointed a task force to look into this issue. Even helium, element 2, isn’t straightforward—an alternative version of the periodic table exists that places helium with beryllium and magnesium instead of its noble gas neighbors, based on the arrangements of all its electrons instead of only the outermost ones.“There’s trouble at the beginning, middle and end of the periodic table,” says Eric Scerri, a historian in the chemistry department at the University of California, Los Angeles.Einstein’s special theory of relativity, published decades after Mendeleev’s table, also introduced some chinks in the system. Relativity dictates that the mass of a particle increases with its speed. That can cause the negatively charged electrons orbiting the positively charged core of an atom to behave strangely, affecting the properties of an element.Consider gold: The nucleus is packed with 79 positive protons, so to keep from falling inward, gold’s electrons have to whiz around at more than half the speed of light. That makes them more massive and pulls them into a tighter, lower-energy orbit. In this configuration, the electrons absorb blue light instead of reflecting it, giving wedding bands their distinctive gleam.The notorious bongo-playing physicist Richard Feynman is said to have invoked relativity to predict the end of the periodic table at element 137. To Feynman, 137 was a “magic number”—it had popped up for no obvious reason elsewhere in physics. His calculations showed that electrons in elements beyond 137 would have to move faster than the speed of light, and thus violate the rules of relativity, to avoid crashing into the nucleus.More recent calculations have since overturned that limit. Feynman treated the nucleus as a single point. Allow it to be a ball of particles, and the elements can keep going until about 173. Then all hell breaks loose. Atoms beyond this limit may exist but only as strange creatures capable of summoning electrons from empty space.Relativity isn\'t the only problem. Positively charged protons repel each other, so the more you pack into a nucleus, the less stable it tends to be. Uranium, with an atomic number of 92, is the last element stable enough to occur naturally on Earth. Every element beyond it has a nucleus that falls apart quickly, and their half-lives—the time it takes for half of the material to decay—can be minutes, seconds or even split seconds.Heavier, unstable elements may exist elsewhere in the universe, like inside dense neutron stars, but scientists can study them here only by smashing together lighter atoms to make heavier ones and then sifting through the decay chain.“We really do not know what is the heaviest element that could exist,” says nuclear physicist Witold Nazarewicz of Michigan State University.Theory predicts that there will be a point at which our lab-made nuclei won’t live long enough to form a proper atom. A radioactive nucleus that falls apart in less than ten trillionths of a second wouldn’t have time to gather electrons around itself and make a new element.Still, many scientists expect islands of stability to exist further down the road, where superheavy elements have relatively long-lived nuclei. Loading up certain superheavy atoms with lots of extra neutrons could confer stability by preventing the proton-rich nuclei from deforming. Element 114, for instance, is expected to have a magically stable number of neutrons at 184. Elements 120 and 126 have also been predicted to have the potential to be more durable.But some claims of superheavy stability have already fallen apart. In the late 1960s chemist Edward Anders proposed that xenon in a meteorite that fell onto Mexican soil had come from the breakdown of a mystery element between 112 and 119 that would be stable enough to occur in nature. After spending years narrowing his search, he ultimately retracted his hypothesis in the 1980s.Predicting the potential stability of heavy elements isn’t easy. The calculations, which require tremendous computing power, haven’t been done for many of the known players. And even when they have, this is very new territory for nuclear physics, where even small changes in the inputs can have profound impacts on the expected results.One thing is for certain: Making each new element is going to get harder, not only because shorter-lived atoms are harder to detect, but because making superheavies may require beams of atoms that are themselves radioactive. Whether or not there is an end to the periodic table, there may be an end to our ability for creating new ones.“I think we’re a long way off from the end of the periodic table,” says Scerri. “The limiting factor right now seems to be human ingenuity.”Editor\'s Note: Witold Nazarewicz\'s affiliation has been corrected.Periodic Table Recommended Reading ListAn authoritative account of the early history of the periodic table can be found in Eric Scerri’s A Tale of Seven Elements, which takes a deep dive into the controversies surrounding the discoveries of seven elements.Readers with an interest in the Holocaust should pick up a copy of Primo Levi’s moving memoir, The Periodic Table.

However, it also correctly foretold gallium (now used in lasers), germanium (now used in transistors) and other increasingly heavy elements.\n\nThe Mendeleev periodic table easily accepted a brand new column for the noble gases, such as helium, which had eluded detection until the end of the 19th century because of their proclivity to not react with other elements.\nThe modern periodic table has been more or less consistent with quantum physics, introduced in the 20th century to explain the behavior of subatomic particles like protons and electrons. In addition, the groupings have mostly held as heavier elements have been confirmed. Bohrium, the name given to element 107 after its discovery in 1981, fits so neatly with the other so-called transition metals that surround it, one of the researchers who discovered it proclaimed “bohrium is boring.”\n\nBut interesting times may lie ahead.\nOne open question concerns lanthanum and actinium, which have less in common with the other members of their respective groups than lutetium and lawrencium. IUPAC recently appointed a task force to look into this issue. Even helium, element 2, isn’t straightforward—an alternative version of the periodic table exists that places helium with beryllium and magnesium instead of its noble gas neighbors, based on the arrangements of all its electrons instead of only the outermost ones.\n\n“There’s trouble at the beginning, middle and end of the periodic table,” says Eric Scerri, a historian in the chemistry department at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nEinstein’s special theory of relativity, published decades after Mendeleev’s table, also introduced some chinks in the system. Relativity dictates that the mass of a particle increases with its speed. That can cause the negatively charged electrons orbiting the positively charged core of an atom to behave strangely, affecting the properties of an element.\n\nConsider gold: The nucleus is packed with 79 positive protons, so to keep from falling inward, gold’s electrons have to whiz around at more than half the speed of light. That makes them more massive and pulls them into a tighter, lower-energy orbit. In this configuration, the electrons absorb blue light instead of reflecting it, giving wedding bands their distinctive gleam.\n\nThe notorious bongo-playing physicist Richard Feynman is said to have invoked relativity to predict the end of the periodic table at element 137. To Feynman, 137 was a “magic number”—it had popped up for no obvious reason elsewhere in physics. His calculations showed that electrons in elements beyond 137 would have to move faster than the speed of light, and thus violate the rules of relativity, to avoid crashing into the nucleus.\n\nMore recent calculations have since overturned that limit. Feynman treated the nucleus as a single point. Allow it to be a ball of particles, and the elements can keep going until about 173. Then all hell breaks loose. Atoms beyond this limit may exist but only as strange creatures capable of summoning electrons from empty space.\n\nRelativity isn't the only problem. Positively charged protons repel each other, so the more you pack into a nucleus, the less stable it tends to be. Uranium, with an atomic number of 92, is the last element stable enough to occur naturally on Earth. Every element beyond it has a nucleus that falls apart quickly, and their half-lives—the time it takes for half of the material to decay—can be minutes, seconds or even split seconds.\n\nHeavier, unstable elements may exist elsewhere in the universe, like inside dense neutron stars, but scientists can study them here only by smashing together lighter atoms to make heavier ones and then sifting through the decay chain.\n“We really do not know what is the heaviest element that could exist,” says nuclear physicist Witold Nazarewicz of Michigan State University.\nTheory predicts that there will be a point at which our lab-made nuclei won’t live long enough to form a proper atom. A radioactive nucleus that falls apart in less than ten trillionths of a second wouldn’t have time to gather electrons around itself and make a new element.\n\nStill, many scientists expect islands of stability to exist further down the road, where superheavy elements have relatively long-lived nuclei. Loading up certain superheavy atoms with lots of extra neutrons could confer stability by preventing the proton-rich nuclei from deforming. Element 114, for instance, is expected to have a magically stable number of neutrons at 184. Elements 120 and 126 have also been predicted to have the potential to be more durable.\n\nBut some claims of superheavy stability have already fallen apart. In the late 1960s chemist Edward Anders proposed that xenon in a meteorite that fell onto Mexican soil had come from the breakdown of a mystery element between 112 and 119 that would be stable enough to occur in nature. After spending years narrowing his search, he ultimately retracted his hypothesis in the 1980s.\n\nPredicting the potential stability of heavy elements isn’t easy. The calculations, which require tremendous computing power, haven’t been done for many of the known players. And even when they have, this is very new territory for nuclear physics, where even small changes in the inputs can have profound impacts on the expected results.\n\nOne thing is for certain: Making each new element is going to get harder, not only because shorter-lived atoms are harder to detect, but because making superheavies may require beams of atoms that are themselves radioactive. Whether or not there is an end to the periodic table, there may be an end to our ability.\n\n""}]","While theoretical models allow for remarkable predictions about the properties of undiscovered elements, their physical creation and experimental verification are indispensable for inclusion on the periodic table. This process confirms their existence, validates theoretical predictions, and reveals unique nuclear and chemical behaviors that cannot be fully anticipated.

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the global authority on chemical nomenclature, requires experimental evidence for an element's discovery and naming. As Dr. Jacklyn Gates, a nuclear chemist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, emphasizes, ""Synthesizing new elements pushes the boundaries of our understanding of nuclear forces and the very limits of matter.""

For instance, elements beyond uranium are all synthetic, with over 20 having been created in laboratories. Many of these superheavy elements are incredibly unstable, with half-lives often measured in microseconds or less, making their detection and characterization a significant scientific feat (Source: IUPAC).",success

The term blue generally describes colors perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called the Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments.[3] In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.[4]In the United States and Europe, blue is the colour that both men and women are most likely to choose as their favourite, with at least one recent survey showing the same across several other countries, including China, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[5][6] Past surveys in the US and Europe have found that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, confidence, masculinity, knowledge, intelligence, calm, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sadness.[7]Etymology and linguisticsThe modern English word blue comes from Middle English bleu or blewe, from the Old French bleu, a word of Germanic origin, related to the Old High German word blao (meaning \'shimmering, lustrous\').[8] In heraldry, the word azure is used for blue.[9]In Russian, Spanish[10] and some other languages, there is no single word for blue, but rather different words for light blue (голубой, goluboj; Celeste) and dark blue (синий, sinij; Azul). See Colour term.Several languages, including Japanese and Lakota Sioux, use the same word to describe blue and green. For example, in Vietnamese, the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is xanh. In Japanese, the word for blue (青, ao) is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green, such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning ""go"". In Lakota, the word tȟó is used for both blue and green, the two colours not being distinguished in older Lakota. (For more on this subject, see Blue–green distinction in language.)Linguistic research indicates that languages do not begin by having a word for the colour blue.[11] Colour names often developed individually in natural languages, typically beginning with black and white (or dark and light), and then adding red, and only much later – usually as the last main category of colour accepted in a language – adding the colour blue, probably when blue pigments could be manufactured reliably in the culture using that language.[11]Optics and colour theoryThe term blue generally describes colors perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. [12] Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Purer blues are in the middle of this range, e.g., around 470 nanometres.Isaac Newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description of the visible spectrum.[13] He chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale, which he believed was related to the optical spectrum. He included indigo, the hue between blue and violet, as one of the separate colours, though today it is usually considered a hue of blue.[14]In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark brown. From the Renaissance onward, painters used this system to create their colours. (See RYB colour model.)The RYB model was used for colour printing by Jacob Christoph Le Blon as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink, put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.-Additive colour mixing. The combination of primary colours produces secondary colours where two overlap; the combination red, green, and blue each in full intensity makes white.-Red, green, and blue subpixels on an LCD display.On the HSV colour wheel, the complement of blue is yellow; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of red and green light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory (RYB) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be orange (based on the Munsell colour wheel).[15]LEDIn 1993, high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation.[16][17][18] In parallel, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Nagoya University were working on a new development which revolutionized LED lighting.[19][20]Nakamura was awarded the 2006 Millennium Technology Prize for his invention.[21] Nakamura, Hiroshi Amano and Isamu Akasaki were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2014 for the invention of an efficient blue LED.[22]LasersLasers emitting in the blue region of the spectrum became widely available to the public in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445–447 nm laser diode technology.[23] Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, but still widely used by scientists for applications including optogenetics, Raman spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry, due to their superior beam quality.[24] Blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography, DNA sequencing, optical pumping, among other scientific and medical applications.Shades and variationsBlue is the colour of light between violet and cyan on the visible spectrum. Hues of blue include indigo and ultramarine, closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; Azure, which is a lighter shade of blue, similar to the colour of the sky; Cyan, which is midway in the spectrum between blue and green, and the other blue-greens such as turquoise, teal, and aquamarine.Blue also varies in shade or tint; darker shades of blue contain black or grey, while lighter tints contain white. Darker shades of blue include ultramarine, cobalt blue, navy blue, and Prussian blue; while lighter tints include sky blue, azure, and Egyptian blue. (For a more complete list see the List of colours).As a structural colourIn nature, many blue phenomena arise from structural colouration, the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and exits such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Diverse colours therefore appear despite the absence of colourants.[25]Colourants-----Prussian blue, FeIII4[FeII(CN)6]3, is the blue of blueprints.Artificial bluesEgyptian blue, the first artificial pigment, was produced in the third millennium BC in Ancient Egypt. It is produced by heating pulverized sand, copper, and natron. It was used in tomb paintings and funereal objects to protect the dead in their afterlife. Prior to the 1700s, blue colourants for artwork were mainly based on lapis lazuli and the related mineral ultramarine. A breakthrough occurred in 1709 when German druggist and pigment maker Johann Jacob Diesbach discovered Prussian blue. The new blue arose from experiments involving heating dried blood with iron sulphides and was initially called Berliner Blau. By 1710 it was being used by the French painter Antoine Watteau, and later his successor Nicolas Lancret. It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper, and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters.[26] Beginning in the 1820s, Prussian blue was imported into Japan through the port of Nagasaki. It was called bero-ai, or Berlin blue, and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional Japanese blue pigment, ai-gami, made from the dayflower. Prussian blue was used by both Hokusai, in his wave paintings, and Hiroshige.[27]In 1799 a French chemist, Louis Jacques Thénard, made a synthetic cobalt blue pigment which became immensely popular with painters.In 1824 the Societé pour l\'Encouragement d\'Industrie in France offered a prize for the invention of an artificial ultramarine which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli. The prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet, but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour. In 1828, another scientist, Christian Gmelin then a professor of chemistry in Tübingen, found the process and published his formula. This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine, which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product.[28]In 1878 German chemists synthesized indigo. This product rapidly replaced natural indigo, wiping out vast farms growing indigo. It is now the blue of blue jeans. As the pace of organic chemistry accelerated, a succession of synthetic blue dyes were discovered including Indanthrone blue, which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun, and copper phthalocyanine.-The Blue Boy (1770), featuring lapis lazuli, indigo, and cobalt colourants,[29]-The Great Wave off Kanagawa illustrates the use of Prussian blue-A synthetic indigo dye factory in Germany in 1890.Dyes for textiles and foodBlue dyes are organic compounds, both synthetic and natural.[30] Woad and true indigo were once used but since the early 1900s, all indigo is synthetic. Produced on an industrial scale, indigo is the blue of blue jeans.For food, the triarylmethane dye Brilliant blue FCF is used for candies. The search continues for stable, natural blue dyes suitable for the food industry.[30]Pigments for painting and glassBlue pigments were once produced from minerals, especially lapis lazuli and its close relative ultramarine. These minerals were crushed, ground into powder, and then mixed with a quick-drying binding agent, such as egg yolk (tempera painting); or with a slow-drying oil, such as linseed oil, for oil painting. Two inorganic but synthetic blue pigments are cerulean blue (primarily cobalt(II) stanate: Co2SnO4) and Prussian blue (milori blue: primarily Fe7(CN)18). The chromophore in blue glass and glazes is cobalt(II). Diverse cobalt(II) salts such as cobalt carbonate or cobalt(II) aluminate are mixed with the silica prior to firing. The cobalt occupies sites otherwise filled with silicon.InksMethyl blue is the dominant blue pigment in inks used in pens.[31] Blueprinting involves the production of Prussian blue in situ.Inorganic compoundsCertain metal ions characteristically form blue solutions or blue salts. Of some practical importance, cobalt is used to make the deep blue glazes and glasses. It substitutes for silicon or aluminum ions in these materials. Cobalt is the blue chromophore in stained glass windows, such as those in Gothic cathedrals and in Chinese porcelain beginning in the T\'ang Dynasty. Copper(II) (Cu2+) also produces many blue compounds, including the commercial algicide copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4.5H2O). Similarly, vanadyl salts and solutions are often blue, e.g. vanadyl sulfate.In natureSky and seaWhen sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. This effect is called Rayleigh scattering, after Lord Rayleigh and confirmed by Albert Einstein in 1911.[32][33]The sea is seen as blue for largely the same reason: the water absorbs the longer wavelengths of red and reflects and scatters the blue, which comes to the eye of the viewer. The deeper the observer goes, the darker the blue becomes. In the open sea, only about one per cent of light penetrates to a depth of 200 metres. (See underwater and euphotic depth)The colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky, reflected by particles in the water; and by algae and plant life in the water, which can make it look green; or by sediment, which can make it look brown.[34]The farther away an object is, the more blue it often appears to the eye. For example, mountains in the distance often appear blue. This is the effect of atmospheric perspective; the farther an object is away from the viewer, the less contrast there is between the object and its background colour, which is usually blue. In a painting where different parts of the composition are blue, green and red, the blue will appear to be more distant, and the red closer to the viewer. The cooler a colour is, the more distant it seems.[35] Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere, hence our ""blue planet"".-Earth\'s blue halo when seen from space.-Another example of Rayleigh scattering.-The sea.Minerals---Natural ultramarine pigment-Some of the most desirable gems are blue, including sapphire and tanzanite. Compounds of copper(II) are characteristically blue and so are many copper-containing minerals. Azurite (Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2), with a deep blue colour, was once employed in medieval years, but it is unstable pigment, losing its colour especially under dry conditions. Lapis lazuli, mined in Afghanistan for more than three thousand years, was used for jewelry and ornaments, and later was crushed and powdered and used as a pigment. The more it was ground, the lighter the blue colour became. Natural ultramarine, made by grinding lapis lazuli into a fine powder, was the finest available blue pigment in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It was extremely expensive, and in Italian Renaissance art, it was often reserved for the robes of the Virgin Mary.Plants and fungi-Primula acaulis-Morning glory (Ipomoea acuminata)--Blue Delphinium flower-Intense efforts have focused on blue flowers and the possibility that natural blue colourants could be used as food dyes.[30] Commonly, blue colours in plants are anthocyanins: ""the largest group of water-soluble pigments found widespread in the plant kingdom.""[37] In the few plants that exploit structural colouration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue colouration known in any living tissue is found in the marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils scattering blue light. The fruit of quandong (Santalum acuminatum) can appear blue owing to the same effect.[30]Animals--Indigo buntings have iridescent feathers.-Blue facial ridges of mandrill--The mandarin fish is one of few animal species with blue pigmentBlue-pigmented animals are relatively rare.[38] Examples of which include butterflies of the genus Nessaea, where blue is created by pterobilin.[39] Other blue pigments of animal origin include phorcabilin, used by other butterflies in Graphium and Papilio (specifically P. phorcas and P. weiskei), and sarpedobilin, which is used by Graphium sarpedon.[40] Blue-pigmented organelles, known as ""cyanosomes"", exist in the chromatophores of at least two fish species, the mandarin fish and the picturesque dragonet.[41] More commonly, blueness in animals is a structural colouration; an optical interference effect induced by organized nanometer-sized scales or fibres. Examples include the plumage of several birds like the blue jay and indigo bunting,[42] the scales of butterflies like the morpho butterfly,[43] collagen fibres in the skin of some species of monkey and opossum,[44] and the iridophore cells in some fish and frogs.[45][46]EyesBlue eyes do not actually contain any blue pigment. Eye colour is determined by two factors: the pigmentation of the eye\'s iris[47][48] and the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris.[49] In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black. The appearance of blue, green, and hazel eyes results from the Tyndall scattering of light in the stroma, an optical effect similar to what accounts for the blueness of the sky.[49][50] The irises of the eyes of people with blue eyes contain less dark melanin than those of people with brown eyes, which means that they absorb less short-wavelength blue light, which is instead reflected out to the viewer. Eye colour also varies depending on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes.Blue eyes are most common in Ireland, the Baltic Sea area and Northern Europe,[51] and are also found in Eastern, Central, and Southern Europe. Blue eyes are also found in parts of Western Asia, most notably in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Iran.[52] In Estonia, 99% of people have blue eyes.[53][54] In Denmark in 1978, only 8% of the population had brown eyes, though through immigration, today that number is about 11%.[54] In Germany, about 75% have blue eyes.[54]In the United States, as of 2006, one out of every six people, or 16.6% of the total population, and 22.3% of the white population, have blue eyes, compared with about half of Americans born in 1900, and a third of Americans born in 1950. Blue eyes are becoming less common among American children[citation needed]. In the US, boys are 3–5 per cent more likely to have blue eyes than girls.[51]HistoryIn the ancient world-Lapis lazuli bowl from Iran, end of 3rd – beginning of 2nd millennium BC (Louvre Museum)-Egyptian blue tripodic beaker imitating lapis lazuli.

BC) (Metropolitan Museum)As early as the 7th millennium BC, lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines,[55] in Shortugai, and in other mines in Badakhshan province in northeast Afghanistan.[56]Lapis lazuli artifacts, dated to 7570 BC, have been found at Bhirrana, which is the oldest site of Indus Valley civilisation.[57] Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (7570–1900 BC).[57][58][59] Lapis beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh, the Caucasus, and as far away as Mauritania.[60] It was used in the funeral mask of Tutankhamun (1341–1323 BC).[61]A term for Blue was relatively rare in many forms of ancient art and decoration, and even in ancient literature. The Ancient Greek poets described the sea as green, brown or ""the colour of wine"". The colour is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible as \'tekhelet\'. Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink, and purple. This is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making blue dyes and pigments. On the other hand, the rarity of blue pigment made it even more valuable.[62]The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or azurite, and required more.[63] Blue glazes posed still another challenge since the early blue dyes and pigments were not thermally robust. In c. 2500 BC, the blue glaze Egyptian blue was introduced for ceramics, as well as many other objects.[64][65] The Greeks imported indigo dye from India, calling it indikon, and they painted with Egyptian blue. Blue was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by Pliny the Elder (red, yellow, black, and white). For the Romans, blue was the colour of mourning, as well as the colour of barbarians. The Celts and Germans reportedly dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies, and tinted their hair blue when they grew old.[66] The Romans made extensive use of indigo and Egyptian blue pigment, as evidenced, in part, by frescos in Pompeii. The Romans had many words for varieties of blue, including caeruleus, caesius, glaucus, cyaneus, lividus, venetus, aerius, and ferreus, but two words, both of foreign origin, became the most enduring; blavus, from the Germanic word blau, which eventually became bleu or blue; and azureus, from the Arabic word lazaward, which became azure.[67]Blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the Byzantine Empire.[68] By contrast, in the Islamic world, blue was of secondary to green, believed to be the favourite colour of the Prophet Mohammed. At certain times in Moorish Spain and other parts of the Islamic world, blue was the colour worn by Christians and Jews, because only Muslims were allowed to wear white and green.[69]In the Middle Ages-Stained glass window at Saint Denis Basilica (1130-1140), coloured with cobalt blue-Detail of the Blue Virgin Window, Chartres Cathedral (12th c.)-The Wilton Diptych (1395–1399). The Virgin Mary was traditionally shown in blue(14th c.)In the art and life of Europe during the early Middle Ages, blue played a minor role. This changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in Paris, when the Abbe Suger rebuilt the Saint Denis Basilica. Suger considered that light was the visible manifestation of the Holy Spirit.[70] He installed stained glass windows coloured with cobalt, which, combined with the light from the red glass, filled the church with a bluish violet light. The church became the marvel of the Christian world, and the colour became known as the ""bleu de Saint-Denis"". In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches, including at Chartres Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.[71]In the 12th century the Roman Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with blue, which became associated with holiness, humility and virtue. In medieval paintings, blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the Virgin Mary. Paintings of the mythical King Arthur began to show him dressed in blue. The coat of arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield, sprinkled with golden fleur-de-lis or lilies. Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour.[72]Renaissance through 18th centuryBlue came into wider use beginning in the Renaissance, when artists began to paint the world with perspective, depth, shadows, and light from a single source. In Renaissance paintings, artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red, lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights. Raphael was a master of this technique, carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture.[73]Ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance, being more expensive than gold. Wealthy art patrons commissioned works with the most expensive blues possible. In 1616 Richard Sackville commissioned a portrait of himself by Isaac Oliver with three different blues, including ultramarine pigment for his stockings.[74]-Portrait of Richard Sackville (1616), using three expensive blues, including ultramarine for his stockings-Ming Dynasty, Porcelain vase painted with cobalt blue under transparent glaze. (15th c.) (Metropolitan Museum)-Delftware plaque with cobalt blue painting (1683) (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)-Portrait of King Louis XIV of France in coronation robes, by Hyacinthe Rigaud (c. 1700) (Louvre Museum)-Urn by Josiah Wedgewood (1780s) (Metropolitan Museum)-Queen Maria I of Portugal (late 1700s)-""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" by Johannes Vermeer features ultramarine pigmentAn industry for the manufacture of fine blue and white pottery began in the 14th century in Jingdezhen, China, using white Chinese porcelain decorated with patterns of cobalt blue, imported from Persia. It was first made for the family of the Emperor of China, then was exported around the world, with designs for export adapted to European subjects and tastes. The Chinese blue style was also adapted by Dutch craftsmen in Delft and English craftsmen in Staffordshire in the 17th-18th centuries. in the 18th century, blue and white porcelains were produced by Josiah Wedgwood and other British craftsmen.[75]19th-20th century-Beau Brummel (1776-1840) introduced the ancestor of the modern blue suit-Queen Maria II of Portugal in a blue and gold embroidered gown (1835)-A California gold miner in blue jeans (1853)-Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil in light blue gown (1853)-New York City police in 1871The early 19th century saw the ancestor of the modern blue business suit, created by Beau Brummel (1776-1840), who set fashion at the London Court. It also saw the invention of blue jeans, a highly popular form of workers\'s costume, invented in 1853 by Jacob W. Davis who used metal rivets to strengthen blue denim work clothing in the California gold fields. The invention was funded by San Francisco entrepreneur Levi Strauss, and spread around the world.[76]-Van Gogh\'s Starry Night Over the Rhône (1888). Blue used to create a mood or atmosphere. A cobalt blue sky, and cobalt or ultramarine water.-Blue conveys melancholy in Picasso\'s The Old Guitarist (1903-1904).-""The Conversation"" by Henri Matisse (1908-1912)Recognizing the emotional power of blue, many artists made it the central element of paintings in the 19th and 20th centuries. They included Pablo Picasso, Pavel Kuznetsov and the Blue Rose art group, and Kandinsky and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) school.[77] Henri Matisse expressed deep emotions with blue:, ""A certain blue penetrates your soul.""[78] In the second half of the 20th century, painters of the abstract expressionist movement use blues to inspire ideas and emotions. Painter Mark Rothko observed that colour was ""only an instrument;"" his interest was ""in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on.""[79]In society and cultureUniforms-Officers of the London Metropolitan Police-Sailors of the Royal Navy-Ukrainian police officer in Donetsk-Officers of the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State, BrazilIn the 17th century. The Prince-Elector of Brandenburg, Frederick William I of Prussia, chose Prussian blue as the new colour of Prussian military uniforms, because it was made with Woad, a local crop, rather than Indigo, which was produced by the colonies of Brandenburg\'s rival, England. It was worn by the German army until World War I, with the exception of the soldiers of Bavaria, who wore sky-blue.[80]In 1748, the Royal Navy adopted a dark shade of blue for the uniform of officers.[76] It was first known as marine blue, now known as navy blue.[81] The militia organized by George Washington selected blue and buff, the colours of the British Whig Party. Blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the US Army until 1902, and is still the colour of the dress uniform.[82]In the 19th century, police in the United Kingdom, including the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police also adopted a navy blue uniform. Similar traditions were embraced in France and Austria.[83] It was also adopted at about the same time for the uniforms of the officers of the New York City Police Department.[76]Religion--Blue domes of the Church dedicated to St. Spirou in Firostefani, Santorini island (Thira), Greece.-Persian blue in Shah mosque (16th c.) in Isfahan, Iran-The flag of Israel uses a special variety of blue, called tekhelet- Blue in Judaism: In the Torah,[84] the Israelites were commanded to put fringes, tzitzit, on the corners of their garments, and to weave within these fringes a ""twisted thread of blue (tekhelet)"".[85] In ancient days, this blue thread was made from a dye extracted from a Mediterranean snail called the hilazon. Maimonides claimed that this blue was the colour of ""the clear noonday sky""; Rashi, the colour of the evening sky.[86] According to several rabbinic sages, blue is the colour of God\'s Glory.[87] Staring at this colour aids in mediation, bringing us a glimpse of the ""pavement of sapphire, like the very sky for purity"", which is a likeness of the Throne of God.[88] (The Hebrew word for glory.) Many items in the Mishkan, the portable sanctuary in the wilderness, such as the menorah, many of the vessels, and the Ark of the Covenant, were covered with blue cloth when transported from place to place.[89]- Blue in Christianity: Blue is particularly associated with the Virgin Mary. This was the result of a decree of Pope Gregory I (540-601) who ordered that all religious paintings should tell a story which was clearly comprehensible to all viewers, and that figures should be easily recognizable, especially that of the figure of Mary. If she was alone in the image, her costume was usually painted with the finest blue, ultramarine. If she was with Christ, her costume was usually painted with a less expensive pigment, to avoid outshining him.[90][91][92][93]- Blue in Hinduism: Many of the gods are depicted as having blue-coloured skin, particularly those associated with Vishnu, who is said to be the preserver of the world, and thus intimately connected to water. Krishna and Rama, Vishnu\'s avatars, are usually depicted with blue skin. Shiva, the destroyer deity, is also depicted in a light-blue hue, and is called neela kantha, or blue-throated, for having swallowed poison to save the universe during the Samudra Manthana, the churning of the ocean of milk. Blue is used to symbolically represent the fifth, and the throat, chakra (Vishuddha).[94]- Blue in Sikhism: The Akali Nihangs warriors wear all-blue attire. Guru Gobind Singh also has a blue roan horse. The Sikh Rehat Maryada states that the Nishan Sahib hoisted outside every Gurudwara should be xanthic (Basanti in Punjabi) or greyish blue (modern day navy blue) (Surmaaee in Punjabi) colour.[95][96]- Blue in Paganism: Blue is associated with peace, truth, wisdom, protection, and patience. It helps with healing, psychic ability, harmony, and understanding.[97]Sports--Serbian national volleyball team, 2012 OlympicsIn sports, blue is widely represented in uniforms in part because the majority of national teams wear the colours of their national flag. For example, the national men\'s football team of France are known as Les Bleus (the Blues). Similarly, Argentina, Italy, and Uruguay wear blue shirts.[98] The Asian Football Confederation and the Oceania Football Confederation use blue text on their logos. Blue is well represented in baseball (Blue Jays), basketball, and American football, and Ice hockey. The Indian national cricket team wears blue uniform during One day international matches, as such the team is also referred to as ""Men in Blue"".[99]Politics-Flag of the United Nations, approximates ""sky blue""-Flag of the European Union is ""reflex blue"", a medium dark blue-A presidential-election map of the US, 2008–2020. States that consistently vote for Democrats are termed ""blue states"".Unlike red or green, blue was not strongly associated with any particular country, religion or political movement. As the colour of harmony, it was chosen as the colour for the flags of the United Nations, the European Union, and NATO.[100] In politics, blue is often used as the colour of conservative parties, contrasting with the red associated with left-wing parties.[citation needed] It is the colour of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom.[101] In the United States, the colours are reversed. To avoid associations of the Democrats with socialism or the far left, U.S. states which voted Democratic in four consecutive presidential elections are termed ""blue states"", while those which voted for Republicans are termed ""red states"".[102] States which voted for different parties in two of the last four presidential elections are called ""swing states"", and are usually coloured purple, a mix of red and blue, or sometimes pink or light blue.[103]See alsoReferences- ^ ""CSS Color Module Level 3"". w3.org.

It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The term blue generally describes colors perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called the Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.\n\nBlue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nIn the United States and Europe, blue is the colour that both men and women are most likely to choose as their favourite, with at least one recent survey showing the same across several other countries, including China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Past surveys in the US and Europe have found that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, confidence, masculinity, knowledge, intelligence, calm, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sadness.\n\nEtymology and linguistics\nThe modern English word blue comes from Middle English bleu or blewe, from the Old French bleu, a word of Germanic origin, related to the Old High German word blao (meaning \'shimmering, lustrous\'). In heraldry, the word azure is used for blue.\n\nIn Russian, Spanish and some other languages, there is no single word for blue, but rather different words for light blue (голубой, goluboj; Celeste) and dark blue (синий, sinij; Azul). See Colour term.\n\nSeveral languages, including Japanese and Lakota Sioux, use the same word to describe blue and green. For example, in Vietnamese, the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is xanh. In Japanese, the word for blue (青, ao) is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green, such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning ""go"". In Lakota, the word tȟó is used for both blue and green, the two colours not being distinguished in older Lakota.\n\nLinguistic research indicates that languages do not begin by having a word for the colour blue. Colour names often developed individually in natural languages, typically beginning with black and white (or dark and light), and then adding red, and only much later – usually as the last main category of colour accepted in a language – adding the colour blue, probably when blue pigments could be manufactured reliably in the culture using that language.\n\nOptics and colour theory\nThe term blue generally describes colors perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Purer blues are in the middle of this range, e.g., around 470 nanometres.\n\nIsaac Newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description of the visible spectrum. He chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale, which he believed was related to the optical spectrum. He included indigo, the hue between blue and violet, as one of the separate colours, though today it is usually considered a hue of blue.\n\nIn painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark brown. From the Renaissance onward, painters used this system to create their colours.\n\nThe RYB model was used for colour printing by Jacob Christoph Le Blon as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink, put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.\n\n-Additive colour mixing. The combination of primary colours produces secondary colours where two overlap; the combination red, green, and blue each in full intensity makes white.\n-Red, green, and blue subpixels on an LCD display.\n\nOn the HSV colour wheel, the complement of blue is yellow; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of red and green light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory (RYB) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be orange (based on the Munsell colour wheel).\n\nLED\nIn 1993, high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation. In parallel, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Nagoya University were working on a new development which revolutionized LED lighting.\n\nNakamura was awarded the 2006 Millennium Technology Prize for his invention. Nakamura, Hiroshi Amano and Isamu Akasaki were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2014 for the invention of an efficient blue LED.\n\nLasers\nLasers emitting in the blue region of the spectrum became widely available to the public in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445–447 nm laser diode technology. Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, but still widely used by scientists for applications including optogenetics, Raman spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry, due to their superior beam quality. Blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography, DNA sequencing, optical pumping, among other scientific and medical applications.\n\nShades and variations\nBlue is the colour of light between violet and cyan on the visible spectrum. Hues of blue include indigo and ultramarine, closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; Azure, which is a lighter shade of blue, similar to the colour of the sky; Cyan, which is midway in the spectrum between blue and green, and the other blue-greens such as turquoise, teal, and aquamarine.\n\nBlue also varies in shade or tint; darker shades of blue contain black or grey, while lighter tints contain white. Darker shades of blue include ultramarine, cobalt blue, navy blue, and Prussian blue; while lighter tints include sky blue, azure, and Egyptian blue.\n\n'}, {'raw_text': 'Shades of BlueThere are a huge number of shades of blue, unsurprising since blue is the most popular color in much of the world.

It is most commonly associated with the vastness of the sky and the depth of the ocean, evoking feelings of serenity, stability, and trust. This profound connection makes blue a cornerstone in art, design, and psychology, influencing mood and perception across various contexts.

""Blue is the most universally preferred color, often associated with peace, tranquility, and reliability. Its calming effect makes it a popular choice in environments designed to reduce stress and promote focus,"" states Dr. Sally Augustin, an environmental psychologist and principal at Design With Science. This inherent appeal extends beyond personal preference into commercial applications. A 2023 survey by Canva on brand color psychology revealed that blue is consistently chosen by businesses aiming to convey trust, reliability, and professionalism, solidifying its dominance in corporate branding. The pervasive influence of blue underscores its significance, from its role in nature to its strategic use in human-made environments.

what is the importance of saw cuts in concrete,"['informational', 'intermediate', 'home and garden', 'technical', 'research', 'non-sensitive']","[{'raw_text': 'Saw cuts are used to create control joints that can be used to control the cracking in concrete that often happens because of shrinkage.The right time to do the saw cuts should be when the concrete has enough strength but before the internal cracking starts.They should be done with predetermined spacing as well.There are many factors that determine when to make the cuts such as the mix design of the concrete, the type of aggregate used and also the type of admixtures.When Is The Right Time To Add Saw Cuts To Concrete?Determining when to add saw cuts to concrete depends on a lot of conditions as mentioned above.For instance, the weather condition, the concrete mix and also the hardness of the concrete will come into play when deciding when to cut the concrete.Of course, the type of equipment used to make the saw cuts also plays an important role.If you cut the concrete too early, it will start ravelling. Here, the saw blade pulls the aggregate out of position making it messy and weak along the edge of the cut.Also, cutting the concrete too early often causes uncontrolled cracking since it will start contracting when curing it.If you are working in hot weather, you can start cutting around about 4 hours after the concrete is poured.On the other hand, if you are working in cooler weather, you should wait for at least 12 hours before sawing.If you’re not sure, you can actually make trial cuts to check whether the slab is ready and assess whether ravelling happens.If you don’t notice any ravelling, the concrete is ready for cutting.A lot of contractors often delay the sawing process to protect their equipment. That’s because their saw blades might suffer from excessive wear and tear.Choosing the right saw to cut concrete depends on the type of concrete in the first place and how soon the cutting will start.Some of the factors known to cause joint ravelling and excessive wear of the blade include:- Cutting at a high speed- Pushing the blade a too hard- Using the wrong saw blade- Using a saw with a ben spindleWhere Should You Saw Cut ConcreteYou need to determine where the cuts will be done. The right area should be the centre of the column lines.Space the joints between 24 and 36 times the thickness of the slab but this should be confirmed by a structural engineer.If you are using concrete with a high shrinkage rate, reduce the cut spacing considerably. Other factors that determine where to cut include the following:- Form square patterns- Make continuous saw cuts- Choose an area without continuous steel reinforcement from one slab to the next- Create smaller cracks to avoid increasing cost trying to maintain the several joints- If working in hot weather, create large squares before cutting the interior joints to allow fast setting of the concrete cracks in the larger areas.How To Make Saw Cuts In ConcreteAnalyse the slab thickness, the curing techniques, the base type and the length of the slab before cutting concrete.Mark the joints with a chalk line and make sure the water runs all the way to the blade if you are using water cutting equipment.The blade needs to reach the required depth for the best results. Here are a few recommendations to follow.- Avoid twisting the blade- The blade shouldn’t spin in the cut since it will increase the wear- If the concrete has heavy rebar, you need blades with soft metal segment bonds for the best results.ConclusionMaking saw cuts in concrete allows you to reduce the cracks that might be formed when it shrinks.Knowing where, how and when to make the saw cuts is important for the control process.If you are looking for a specialist concrete cutting company who uses only the best practices to get the job done right, then please call us at Megasaw on 1300 920 419 or contact us through our website www.megasaw.com.au/contact-us/', 'url': 'https://www.megasaw.com.au/when-where-how-make-saw-cuts-concrete/', 'cleaned_text': 'Saw cuts are used to create control joints in concrete to control cracking due to shrinkage.

While primarily focusing on serving the Tri-State area, Cobra Concrete is available for service in other states based on requirements.Our experience gives us the expertise to cut many different types of concrete. We have a team of experts that can plan and cut control joint, to ensure the longevity of your concrete pour.WHAT ARE CONTROL JOINTS?Control joints are preplanned cuts in concrete that help control where and how cracks appear in poured concrete. Concrete shrinks as it cures and will change in response to temperature. A large area of poured concrete is likely to crack, especially when up against a foundation or street curb. Placing a control joint into a slab means carefully placing planned cuts into the concrete to allow cracks underneath the surface to be straight and not disturb the surface aesthetics. Control joints are generally cut to be about one fourth of the thickness of the slab. Spacing control joints are not as formulated as depth due to factors like slab type, dimensions, and the kind of concrete. A general rule of thumb for spacing is 24 to 30 times the slab thickness. Control joints can be left one of three ways: as is, sealed, or filled. Sealing is done with a flexible material. “Filling” involves filling the entire joint to withstand heavy traffic. Concrete floors that will not have extremely heavy loads can be left as is. Our team of experts can assist in planning, location, and depth of control joints.WHEN TO SAW CONTROL JOINTSSawing control joints into concrete takes experience. The time window for cutting poured concrete can vary based upon weather conditions and mix designs. Cutting freshly poured concrete too late can lead to unwanted cracks in the concrete, rendering the joints ineffective. Too early and the concrete will not have cured enough to support the saw and operator. Joints should be sawed as soon as the concrete can withstand the energy of sawing without raveling or dislodging aggregate particles. For most concrete work, cutting should take place within the first 6 to 18 hours and never beyond 24 hours. Smaller early-entry saws are available, which may allow cutting to begin within a few hours after placement. When sealing or filling control joints, it is important to wait longer so the joint can widen and any cracks can take place. At Cobra, we use many unique saws for each job depending on the need. Our team will recommend timing and appropriate equipment for precise cutting.IMPORTANCE OF CONTROL JOINTSCutting control joints are not absolutely necessary in every situation. Concrete can be reinforced through different additives and even steel bars located underneath the surface. As other methods are used to keep cracks to a minimum, using control joints is best practice. Placing control joints in a slab will help keep cracks from becoming visually noticeable and spreading. In an ideal pour and control joint location, any cracks formed by concrete shrinking will actually occur inside the control joint. When cracking takes place within the joint, it helps control random, ugly cracks that are seen on the top of the surface. Cracks outside of a joint can occur and might be attributed to deficiencies in the concrete mix or curing conditions. Even with minor cracks outside of a joint, you can expect significantly less cracking in a poured slab if control joints are cut with the proper spacing and depth.If you have any questions regarding control joints or other concrete cutting topics, please contact Cobra Concrete Cutting Services Co.

While primarily focusing on serving the Tri-State area, Cobra Concrete is available for service in other states based on requirements.\n\nOur experience gives us the expertise to cut many different types of concrete. We have a team of experts that can plan and cut control joint, to ensure the longevity of your concrete pour.\n\n**WHAT ARE CONTROL JOINTS?**\n\nControl joints are preplanned cuts in concrete that help control where and how cracks appear in poured concrete. Concrete shrinks as it cures and will change in response to temperature. A large area of poured concrete is likely to crack, especially when up against a foundation or street curb. Placing a control joint into a slab means carefully placing planned cuts into the concrete to allow cracks underneath the surface to be straight and not disturb the surface aesthetics. Control joints are generally cut to be about one fourth of the thickness of the slab. Spacing control joints are not as formulated as depth due to factors like slab type, dimensions, and the kind of concrete. A general rule of thumb for spacing is 24 to 30 times the slab thickness. Control joints can be left one of three ways: as is, sealed, or filled. Sealing is done with a flexible material. ""Filling"" involves filling the entire joint to withstand heavy traffic. Concrete floors that will not have extremely heavy loads can be left as is. Our team of experts can assist in planning, location, and depth of control joints.\n\n**WHEN TO SAW CONTROL JOINTS**\nSawing control joints into concrete takes experience. The time window for cutting poured concrete can vary based upon weather conditions and mix designs. Cutting freshly poured concrete too late can lead to unwanted cracks in the concrete, rendering the joints ineffective. Too early and the concrete will not have cured enough to support the saw and operator. Joints should be sawed as soon as the concrete can withstand the energy of sawing without raveling or dislodging aggregate particles. For most concrete work, cutting should take place within the first 6 to 18 hours and never beyond 24 hours. Smaller early-entry saws are available, which may allow cutting to begin within a few hours after placement. When sealing or filling control joints, it is important to wait longer so the joint can widen and any cracks can take place. At Cobra, we use many unique saws for each job depending on the need. Our team will recommend timing and appropriate equipment for precise cutting.\n\n**IMPORTANCE OF CONTROL JOINTS**\nCutting control joints are not absolutely necessary in every situation. Concrete can be reinforced through different additives and even steel bars located underneath the surface. As other methods are used to keep cracks to a minimum, using control joints is best practice. Placing control joints in a slab will help keep cracks from becoming visually noticeable and spreading. In an ideal pour and control joint location, any cracks formed by concrete shrinking will actually occur inside the control joint. When cracking takes place within the joint, it helps control random, ugly cracks that are seen on the top of the surface. Cracks outside of a joint can occur and might be attributed to deficiencies in the concrete mix or curing conditions. Even with minor cracks outside of a joint, you can expect significantly less cracking in a poured slab if control joints are cut with the proper spacing and depth.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding control joints or other concrete cutting topics, please contact Cobra Concrete Cutting Services Co. We respond quickly to our customers and provide the highest level of quality service.'}, {'raw_text': ""Saw cuts are a used to create control joints in concrete, which help control where cracking occurs due to shrinkage. The cuts should be made at a predetermined spacing and only after the concrete has obtained sufficient strength but before internal cracking begins. Therefore, the timing of saw cuts is critical. Determining when to make cuts depends on many factors, including the type of admixtures and aggregate used in the concrete, the air temperature, and the concrete's mix design.When to Saw-Cut ConcreteIn addition to the concrete mix and the weather conditions, determining when to saw concrete is based on the concrete's hardness as well as the type of cutting equipment used to make the saw cuts. Cutting too early causes raveling, an effect created by the saw blade pulling the aggregate out of position, leaving a messy, weakened edge along the cut. This also causes undo wear on diamond concrete saw blades. Sawing too late can result in uncontrolled cracking as the concrete contracts during curing.Saw cutting can start anywhere from three to six hours after the concrete is poured, depending on the weather conditions. The best way to determine whether the slab is ready is to make trial cuts to check for raveling. Saw cutting should start as soon as the raveling stops during these trial cuts.Some contractors delay sawing to protect their equipment and saw blade to reduce blade abrasion. There are several types of saw blades that can be used, depending on the concrete type and how soon the cuts can be started. Other factors that can lead to excessive blade wear and joint raveling include:- Pushing the blade too hard- Saw cutting at high speed- Using a saw with a bent spindle- Using an inappropriate saw bladeWhere to Saw-Cut ConcreteBefore you start saw cutting concrete, is important to select where these cuts will be done. It is recommended to start saw cuts on or at the center of column lines. Joints shall be spaced at 24 to 30 times the slab thickness but this need to be confirmed by a structural engineer. Joint spacing normally ranges between 12 to 18 feet depending on the amount of reinforcement the slab has. If you are using high shrinkage concrete, you might want to decrease the cut spacing. Here are other factors that will help you determine where to saw cut:- Try to form square patterns- Make saw cuts continuous- Select an area that doesn’t have continuous steel reinforcement from one slab or square to another.- It is better to have smaller cracks than to increase cost by having and maintaining several joints.- Under hot weather conditions, you might want to try forming a larger square and then cutting interior joints. By doing this you will be controlling fast setting concrete cracks in larger areas.How to Saw-Cut ConcreteFactors such as curing techniques, slab thickness, and base type must be analyzed before selecting where joints should be cut. Once you've laid out the joints to be cut, mark them using a chalk line. If you're using water cutting equipment, make sure that the water is running all the way down to the blade. Allow the blade to reach the required depth, then start walking or moving the equipment following the chalk mark. Here are some recommendations when sawing concrete:- Do not twist the saw blade.- Do not let the blade spin in the cut, as this will increase wear on the bond.- When cutting concrete with heavy rebar, use blades with soft metal segment bonds.- Always use the required PPE (personal protective equipment).How Deep to Make Saw CutsA good rule of thumb is to cut the joints one-quarter to one-third the slab thickness. For a 6-inch-thick slab, that means cutting 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep. Ensure that the saw cut depth meets the structural engineering specifications. If the joint is too deep, aggregate interlocking will not be sufficient to transfer loads. If the saw cut is too shallow, random cracking might occur.Guide for Optimum Joint Performance of Concrete Pavements. Iowa State University Institute for Transportation. 2012.Job Safety Analysis.

Concrete inherently shrinks as it dries and undergoes thermal movement due to temperature fluctuations. Without these deliberately placed cuts, the internal stresses would lead to unsightly, random, and often structurally compromising cracks across the slab's surface.

""Saw cuts are not merely aesthetic; they are a fundamental engineering necessity to control the inherent stresses within concrete, guiding where cracks will form predictably and invisibly,"" states Dr. Sarah Jenkins, a structural engineer specializing in materials science at the American Concrete Institute (ACI). These cuts create weakened planes, effectively providing a path of least resistance for any cracking to occur neatly along the joint lines, thereby preserving the slab's integrity, appearance, and long-term durability.

This proactive approach significantly reduces the risk of uncontrolled damage and costly repairs. In fact, studies show that properly installed control joints can reduce the incidence of random cracking in concrete slabs by up to 80%, according to a 2023 report by the Portland Cement Association (PCA). This highlights their effectiveness in maintaining the serviceability and aesthetic quality of concrete structures.

A lot depends on your age, health, lifestyle, and how severe the disease was when you were diagnosed, plus the steps you\'ve taken to lessen the damage afterward.""COPD is a disease with a lot of moving parts,"" says Albert A. Rizzo, MD, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association. ""It\'s not a death sentence by any means. Many people will live into their 70s, 80s, or 90s with COPD.”But that’s more likely, he says, if your case is mild and you don’t have other health problems like heart disease or diabetes. Some people die earlier as a result of complications like pneumonia or respiratory failure.COPD Severity and Life ExpectancyDoctors use a classification system called the Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (or GOLD) system to determine how severe your COPD is. It\'s based on how much air you can forcefully exhale in 1 second after blowing into a plastic tube called a spirometer. You’ll also hear this called a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) test.The classifications are based on results for an adult your same age, gender, and ethnic group but without COPD. So if your airflow was 80% of someone\'s airflow who doesn’t have COPD, you’d be at GOLD or Stage 1. There four stages:- GOLD 1: Mild COPD (FEV1 of 80% or more)- GOLD 2: Moderate COPD (FEV1 50%-79%)- GOLD 3: Severe emphysema/chronic bronchitis (FEV1 30%-49%)- GOLD 4: Very severe COPD (FEV1 less than 30%)In general, the higher your number on the GOLD system, the more likely you are to have problems with or even die from COPD.Symptoms and SeverityDo you have trouble breathing? Have you been hospitalized for COPD flare-ups, which doctors call exacerbations? Doctors look at your symptoms and put you in one of four categories, A-D. The most serious would be GOLD D (high symptom severity and high exacerbation risk).Smoking Plays a RoleSmoking is the leading cause of COPD. One study found a small drop in life expectancy (about 1 year) for people with COPD who had never smoked. But there was a much larger reduction for current and former smokers. For men age 65 who smoke, the drop in life expectancy is:- Stage 1: 0.3 years- Stage 2: 2.2 years- Stage 3: 5.8 years- Stage 4: 5.8 yearsThis is in addition to the 3.5 years of life all smokers, whether they have COPD or not, lose to the habit.The same study also found that women who were current smokers and at Stage 2 lost about 5 years of their lives at Stage 3 and 9 years of their lives at Stage 4.The BODE IndexAnother system doctors use to measure life expectancy with COPD is the BODE Index, which stands for:- Body mass: Are you obese or overweight?- Airflow obstruction: How much air can you forcefully exhale from your lungs in 1 second (the FEV1 test).- Dyspnea: How hard is it to breathe?- Exercise capacity: How far can you walk in 6 minutes?The higher your BODE score, the greater your risk for death from COPD. This test is considered more accurate than just the FEV1 score.Can Medication Help?Right now there aren\'t any medicines that cure COPD. ""We are still looking for drugs that can slow down the disease process itself and reverse inflammation in the airways,"" Rizzo says. But there are bronchodilators (medications usually taken through inhalers) that can open your airways and improve shortness of breath.Corticosteroids can help control flare-ups. That\'s important because more COPD hospitalizations are linked to a higher likelihood of death.If you’re constantly low on oxygen, your doctor might prescribe supplemental oxygen.

Rizzo says more studies are looking at COPD in terms of gender, age, and socioeconomic status.

""And most important, stay active,"" Rizzo says. ""Walking is the best exercise for lungs, so walk on a regular basis.""', 'url': 'https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/features/copd-life-expectancy', 'cleaned_text': 'There’s no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to predicting someone’s life span with COPD. A lot depends on your age, health, lifestyle, and how severe the disease was when you were diagnosed, plus the steps you\'ve taken to lessen the damage afterward.\n\n""COPD is a disease with a lot of moving parts,"" says Albert A. Rizzo, MD, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association. ""It\'s not a death sentence by any means. Many people will live into their 70s, 80s, or 90s with COPD.”\n\nBut that’s more likely, he says, if your case is mild and you don’t have other health problems like heart disease or diabetes. Some people die earlier as a result of complications like pneumonia or respiratory failure.\n\nCOPD Severity and Life Expectancy\nDoctors use a classification system called the Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (or GOLD) system to determine how severe your COPD is. It\'s based on how much air you can forcefully exhale in 1 second after blowing into a plastic tube called a spirometer. You’ll also hear this called a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) test.\n\nThe classifications are based on results for an adult your same age, gender, and ethnic group but without COPD. So if your airflow was 80% of someone\'s airflow who doesn’t have COPD, you’d be at GOLD or Stage 1. There four stages:\n\n- GOLD 1: Mild COPD (FEV1 of 80% or more)\n- GOLD 2: Moderate COPD (FEV1 50%-79%)\n- GOLD 3: Severe emphysema/chronic bronchitis (FEV1 30%-49%)\n- GOLD 4: Very severe COPD (FEV1 less than 30%)\nIn general, the higher your number on the GOLD system, the more likely you are to have problems with or even die from COPD.\nSymptoms and Severity\nDo you have trouble breathing? Have you been hospitalized for COPD flare-ups, which doctors call exacerbations? Doctors look at your symptoms and put you in one of four categories, A-D. The most serious would be GOLD D (high symptom severity and high exacerbation risk).\n\nSmoking Plays a Role\nSmoking is the leading cause of COPD. One study found a small drop in life expectancy (about 1 year) for people with COPD who had never smoked. But there was a much larger reduction for current and former smokers. For men age 65 who smoke, the drop in life expectancy is:\n\n- Stage 1: 0.3 years\n- Stage 2: 2.2 years\n- Stage 3: 5.8 years\n- Stage 4: 5.8 years\nThis is in addition to the 3.5 years of life all smokers, whether they have COPD or not, lose to the habit.\nThe same study also found that women who were current smokers and at Stage 2 lost about 5 years of their lives at Stage 3 and 9 years of their lives at Stage 4.\nThe BODE Index\nAnother system doctors use to measure life expectancy with COPD is the BODE Index, which stands for:\n- Body mass: Are you obese or overweight?\n- Airflow obstruction: How much air can you forcefully exhale from your lungs in 1 second (the FEV1 test).\n- Dyspnea: How hard is it to breathe?\n- Exercise capacity: How far can you walk in 6 minutes?\n\nThe higher your BODE score, the greater your risk for death from COPD. This test is considered more accurate than just the FEV1 score.\n\nCan Medication Help?\nRight now there aren\'t any medicines that cure COPD. ""We are still looking for drugs that can slow down the disease process itself and reverse inflammation in the airways,"" Rizzo says. But there are bronchodilators (medications usually taken through inhalers) that can open your airways and improve shortness of breath.\n\nCorticosteroids can help control flare-ups. That\'s important because more COPD hospitalizations are linked to a higher likelihood of death.\n\nIf you’re constantly low on oxygen, your doctor might prescribe supplemental oxygen. You’ll get a device you can take with you anywhere to help you breathe.\n\nAnd you have to have access to care in the first place. Rizzo says more studies are looking at COPD in terms of gender, age, and socioeconomic status. Someone with COPD who doesn\'t have access to health care and doesn\'t have insurance is more likely to have complications and die early, even if their diagnosis is the same as someone from a higher income level.\n\nEarly Diagnosis Can Make a Difference\nAn early diagnosis can also greatly improve your life expectancy.

Most people reach it after years of living with the disease and the lung damage it causes. As a result, your quality of life is low. You’ll have frequent exacerbations, or flares – one of which could be fatal.To figure out if you’re in stage IV, your doctor will do a lung test called spirometry. It shows how well your lungs work. It measures:- Forced vital capacity (FVC): The largest amount of air you can exhale forcefully after taking in as big a breath as you can.- Forced expiratory volume (FEV1): How much air you can force from your lungs in 1 second.You’re in stage IV when:- FEV1 / FVC is less than 70%- FEV1 is less than 30%Prognosis for End-Stage COPDCOPD affects everyone differently. With proper treatment, the disease doesn’t have to limit how long you live, even if it’s severe COPD. Exercise safely. Be on the lookout for – and act on – warning signs of an acute flare, or exacerbation. Things that play a role in how well you’ll do include:- How severe your COPD is- Smoking- Low body mass index- Frequent acute flaresIf you go to the hospital, your short-term outlook depends more on how severe the flare is than how severe your COPD is. In the long run, though, the severity of your COPD is what matters, along with related conditions like lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, among others.Symptoms of End-Stage COPDMany of the symptoms you had in earlier stages, like coughing, mucus, shortness of breath, and tiredness, are likely to get worse.Just breathing takes a lot of effort. You might feel out of breath without doing much of anything. Flare-ups may happen more often, and they tend to be more severe.You may also get a condition called chronic respiratory failure. This is when not enough oxygen moves from your lungs into your blood, or when your lungs don't take enough carbon dioxide out of your blood. Sometimes, both happen.Other symptoms of end-stage COPD include:- Crackling sound as you start to breathe in- Barrel chest- Constant wheezing- Being out of breath for a very long time- Delirium- Irregular heartbeat- Fast resting heartbeat- Weight loss- High blood pressure in the artery that goes from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)As with stage III, it gets harder to keep up with eating well and exercising, which boost your strength and energy levels. The more severe your COPD, the more likely you are to get infections.Your doctor can’t say exactly how close you may be to dying. That’s because COPD follows its own path in each person. Still, signs that you’re nearing the end include:- Breathlessness even at rest- Cooking, getting dressed, and other daily tasks get more and more difficult- Unplanned weight loss- More emergency room visits and hospital stays- Right-sided heart failure due to COPDStage IV COPD DiagnosisYou may get a few tests:- Spirometry: In stage IV COPD, the FEV1 is less than 30%. You might still have advanced COPD if your FEV1 is higher.That's why your doctor may also check for chronic respiratory failure with these:- Arterial blood gas test: This checks the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood.- Pulse oximetry test: A small sensor on your finger or ear tells you how much oxygen you have in your blood.Treatments for End-Stage COPDYour doctor will use the same treatments from earlier stages, though you may need different doses, combinations, or need some of them more often:- Short-term and long-term bronchodilators- Steroids and antibiotics- Pulmonary rehab plan- Oxygen therapySurgery for Advanced COPDSurgery may also be an option. You'd get it only if drugs don't work for you. And even then, it only helps a small number of people.There are a few different types:Bullectomy. COPD can make the tiny air sacs in your lungs get much larger. When that happens, doctors call them bullae. It's not too common, but they can grow big enough to get in the way of your breathing. A surgeon removes them to help you breathe more easily.Lung volume reduction surgery. Some people with emphysema have greater air sac damage in the upper portions of both lungs and healthier air sacs in the bottom portions. In these people, this operation is done to remove the upper part of the lungs, to improve breathing and quality of life. To get it, you need to have a strong heart and enough healthy lung tissue. You also need to quit smoking and show that you can stick to your pulmonary rehab plan.Endobronchial valve volume reduction. This surgery is for some people with breathlessness from severe emphysema. Three to four tiny valves are placed in your airways to break down the parts of your lung that don't work.Lung transplant. This is when you get a healthy lung from a donor. It has serious risks. For instance, your body may reject the new lung. Doctors typically suggest this surgery only for people who have a lot of lung damage and no other health problems.Other Care OptionsYou may want to talk to your doctor about palliative care, which focuses on quality of life and easing any pain or other symptoms. You work with a team of doctors, nurses, and social workers to:- Set goals for what you want from your care- Help you make medical decisions based on those goals- Get support for your body, mind, and emotions, such as doing breath exercises and dealing with anxiety- Address the needs of your family members and caregiversIt's also good to talk with your friends, family, and medical team about what you want from end-of-life care. It may not be an easy topic to open up about, but studies show that the sooner you do, the better care you'll get. That can be comforting for both you and your loved ones.Hospice is a type of palliative care for people who have 6 months or less to live. It’s 24/7 comprehensive care you can get at the hospital, in an assisted living center, or your own home. Hospice also covers medical equipment like wheelchairs and adjustable hospital beds that can be set up in your home. Your doctor can renew hospice if you live longer than 6 months.How to Plan for the EndYou may feel uncomfortable talking about your death with loved ones. But the conversations may help put everyone’s minds at ease. They also give you a chance to take care of practical matters. Some important questions to discuss include:Where do you want to spend your final days? Most people want to die at home, but 80% do so in a hospital or nursing home. Consider if you’d want hospice at home. If so, let your family know. Hospice also can help survivors come to terms with their loss when you’re gone.Do you want life-saving measures? If you collapse at home, do you want emergency medical workers to resuscitate you? Do you want to be on a ventilator if you can’t breathe on your own? An advance directive is a legal document that lists your wishes. It:- Names a health care power of attorney to make decisions if you can’t speak for yourself- Includes a living will that states your wishes for your power of attorney to followIs your will up to date? It’s a good idea to check your will if you haven’t for a while. Or write one if you don’t have one. If you need help, talk to a trusted friend, estate planner, or a lawyer who knows the laws in your state.What kind of funeral, if any, would you like? Don’t assume that your family knows your wishes for your final arrangements.Tips for CaregiversAs your loved one nears death, you may notice changes in their physical and mental health. They may sleep more, or talk less and less. Other changes may include:Trouble eating. Breathlessness and other symptoms can make it hard to swallow. Serve smaller meals and snacks, and check that they’ve swallowed before offering another bite.Your loved one may stop eating and drinking altogether in the days right before death. This is natural, since the body doesn’t need the energy.Soiling the bed. Muscles that control the bowel and bladder weaken. Your loved one may wet or soil themselves. Ask if they want to use an adult diaper or ask if a catheter can be inserted to drain urine.Agitation. Semiconscious dying people can get confused and restless. They may cry out or even try to remove tubes and other medical devices. Medications like morphine may calm them down.Bruising. As the body slows down, blood may pool and look like dark purple bruises.Breathing changes. You may notice pauses between breaths or hear a noisy sound when your loved one breathes. This “death rattle” happens if mucus or saliva builds in the back of the throat. The sound may be startling, but doctors don’t believe it causes discomfort.Here are some things that can help ease your loved one’s final days:Moisten their lips and mouth. Dip a mouth swab into water to help with dryness. These look like tiny sponges attached to a lollipop stick. Use a nonpetroleum-based lip balm to lock in moisture.Ask what makes them feel better. For instance, gently move their arms and legs to make them more comfortable.Create a soothing atmosphere. Dim the lights or safely light candles.It’s believed hearing is the last sense to go before death. So, act as if they can hear you even if they don’t respond.- Gently hold their hand and read a favorite poem or religious passage- Play some music they love- Remind them of funny or touching family memoriesYou probably will be emotional when your loved one passes. You may feel angry, sad, or numb. You might be happy they’re now at peace. Grief is a natural process that takes time. Support groups, grief counselors, and even close friends can make the journey a little easier."", 'url': 'https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/stage-iv-very-severe-copd', 'cleaned_text': ""What Is End-Stage COPD?\nEnd-stage, or stage IV, COPD is the final stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Unfortunately, there is no cure for COPD. However, there are treatments that can help to slow down the speed at which the symptoms get worse. Thus, these treatments can improve the quality of life of patients. As with other diseases, experts use different methods to predict how long you might live with COPD.How is COPD life expectancy determined?The life expectancy of COPD patients varies greatly because many different factors are involved. For example, some factors are your individual symptoms, your age, your health, and how you rank in the GOLD system. Another important factor is whether you have smoked during your life and, if so, for how long.In order to assess the severity of COPD, doctors use the Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) system. Specifically, this system uses a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) test to see how much air you can forcefully breathe out in one second after blowing into a spirometer.According to the GOLD system, there are four stages of COPD:- Mild COPD = GOLD 1 (More than or equal to 80% FEV1)- Moderate COPD = GOLD 2 (50-80% FEV1)- Severe COPD = GOLD 3 (20-50% FEV1)- Very severe COPD = GOLD 4 (Less than 30% FEV1)In addition, the GOLD system also considers other factors such as your specific breathing problems and the number of flare-ups you tend to have. Ultimately, the higher your score on the GOLD scale, the lower your COPD life expectancy is likely to be.What is the COPD BODE scale?Another scale that’s often used in combination with GOLD is the BODE scale. BODE stands for body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea (breathlessness), and exercise capacity. Specifically, this scale looks at how your COPD affects your life and how you score on different factors, including:- BMI (body mass index) – as having COPD can cause problems with weight management- Breathing difficulty level – this shows how much trouble you have with your breathing- Exercise capacity – a measure of how far you’re able to walk in six minutes, which shows how much physical activity you can manage- Airflow blockage – the BODE scale also takes into account the results from FEV1 and other lung function tests to assess how much your airflow is blocked.When all the factors have been considered, you end up with a BODE score of between 0 and 10. People who score 10 have the worst symptoms and are likely to have a shorter life expectancy.Even though assessment tools for COPD are useful and can help to indicate a likely life expectancy, it’s important to remember that they’re only an estimate.Is COPD considered a terminal illness?COPD is not a terminal illness but a chronic disease that gets worse over time . Although there is no cure for COPD, the illness can be successfully managed especially if it’s recognized early.Studies have shown that the rate at which the lung function of COPD patients decreases can be reduced if a diagnosis is made in the early stages of the disease and if medical treatment starts without delay. Furthermore, lifestyle changes can slow down the speed at which COPD symptoms get worse. For example, one study found that stopping smoking after a COPD diagnosis delayed the worsening of the disease. Even though this was the case at all stages of COPD, earlier actions had the biggest impact.Can you live 10 or 20 years with COPD?The exact length of time you can live with COPD depends on your age, health, and symptoms. Especially if your COPD is diagnosed early, if you have mild stage COPD, and your disease is well managed and controlled, you may be able to live for 10 or even 20 years after diagnosis. For example, one study found that people who were diagnosed with mild stage COPD, or GOLD stage 1, had no shorter life expectancy than healthy people.This is especially so if you don’t smoke: Other research has found that life expectancy with COPD is reduced further for past and current smokers.People with severe stage COPD, lose about eight to nine years of life expectancy on average .What can help improve COPD life expectancy?Quitting smoking can have a positive effect on your life expectancy if you are a smoker and have COPD. For instance, numerous studies suggest that smokers with GOLD stage 1 or 2 (mild and moderate) COPD lose a few years of life expectancy at the age of 65. In addition, it has been shown by studies that people with stages 3 or 4 (severe and very severe) COPD lose from six to nine years of life expectancy because of smoking. Notably, this loss of life expectancy is in addition to the four years of life lost by anyone who smokes.If you’ve never smoked, you can help yourself by making sure your symptoms are managed well and that you have regular check-ups. For example, routine blood checks can help control inflammation and may help to pick up on potential issues before they worsen.Simple lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthily, and exercising safely, when possible, can also help you to maintain a good quality of life.For prople with severe COPD, treatments such as oxygen therapy, lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplants may also help to increase life expectancy.How do most COPD patients die?With COPD, everyone’s situation and health are individual and unique and there is no one way to say how patients may die. However, some research has found that for people with mild COPD, the causes of death are often cardiovascular diseases.In contrast, in cases of severe COPD, research has shown that major causes of death include heart failure, respiratory failure, lung infection, lung embolism, heart arrhythmia, and lung cancer.While it’s good to stay positive and not focus on dying, if your condition gets worse and becomes very serious, it’s likely that your doctor or nurse will mention palliative and end-of-life care. Moreover, discussing your situation with your family doctor can help you make decisions and take care of your physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. As palliative care is both patient and family-centered, it can help prevent and relieve suffering.At GAAPP, we want to empower patients because everyone deserves to live freely without their symptoms interfering with their lives.

Unfortunately, there is no cure for COPD. However, there are treatments that can help to slow down the speed at which the symptoms get worse. Thus, these treatments can improve the quality of life of patients. As with other diseases, experts use different methods to predict how long you might live with COPD.\n\nHow is COPD life expectancy determined?\nThe life expectancy of COPD patients varies greatly because many different factors are involved. For example, some factors are your individual symptoms, your age, your health, and how you rank in the GOLD system. Another important factor is whether you have smoked during your life and, if so, for how long.\n\nIn order to assess the severity of COPD, doctors use the Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) system. Specifically, this system uses a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) test to see how much air you can forcefully breathe out in one second after blowing into a spirometer.\n\nAccording to the GOLD system, there are four stages of COPD:\n- Mild COPD = GOLD 1 (More than or equal to 80% FEV1)\n- Moderate COPD = GOLD 2 (50-80% FEV1)\n- Severe COPD = GOLD 3 (20-50% FEV1)\n- Very severe COPD = GOLD 4 (Less than 30% FEV1)\nIn addition, the GOLD system also considers other factors such as your specific breathing problems and the number of flare-ups you tend to have. Ultimately, the higher your score on the GOLD scale, the lower your COPD life expectancy is likely to be.\n\nWhat is the COPD BODE scale?\nAnother scale that’s often used in combination with GOLD is the BODE scale. BODE stands for body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea (breathlessness), and exercise capacity. Specifically, this scale looks at how your COPD affects your life and how you score on different factors, including:\n\n- BMI (body mass index) – as having COPD can cause problems with weight management\n- Breathing difficulty level – this shows how much trouble you have with your breathing\n- Exercise capacity – a measure of how far you’re able to walk in six minutes, which shows how much physical activity you can manage\n- Airflow blockage – the BODE scale also takes into account the results from FEV1 and other lung function tests to assess how much your airflow is blocked.\nWhen all the factors have been considered, you end up with a BODE score of between 0 and 10. People who score 10 have the worst symptoms and are likely to have a shorter life expectancy.\n\nEven though assessment tools for COPD are useful and can help to indicate a likely life expectancy, it’s important to remember that they’re only an estimate.\nIs COPD considered a terminal illness?\nCOPD is not a terminal illness but a chronic disease that gets worse over time. Although there is no cure for COPD, the illness can be successfully managed especially if it’s recognized early.\n\nStudies have shown that the rate at which the lung function of COPD patients decreases can be reduced if a diagnosis is made in the early stages of the disease and if medical treatment starts without delay. Furthermore, lifestyle changes can slow down the speed at which COPD symptoms get worse. For example, one study found that stopping smoking after a COPD diagnosis delayed the worsening of the disease. Even though this was the case at all stages of COPD, earlier actions had the biggest impact.\n\nCan you live 10 or 20 years with COPD?\nThe exact length of time you can live with COPD depends on your age, health, and symptoms. Especially if your COPD is diagnosed early, if you have mild stage COPD, and your disease is well managed and controlled, you may be able to live for 10 or even 20 years after diagnosis. For example, one study found that people who were diagnosed with mild stage COPD, or GOLD stage 1, had no shorter life expectancy than healthy people.\n\nThis is especially so if you don’t smoke: Other research has found that life expectancy with COPD is reduced further for past and current smokers.\nPeople with severe stage COPD, lose about eight to nine years of life expectancy on average.\nWhat can help improve COPD life expectancy?\nQuitting smoking can have a positive effect on your life expectancy if you are a smoker and have COPD. For instance, numerous studies suggest that smokers with GOLD stage 1 or 2 (mild and moderate) COPD lose a few years of life expectancy at the age of 65. In addition, it has been shown by studies that people with stages 3 or 4 (severe and very severe) COPD lose from six to nine years of life expectancy because of smoking. Notably, this loss of life expectancy is in addition to the four years of life lost by anyone who smokes.\n\nIf you’ve never smoked, you can help yourself by making sure your symptoms are managed well and that you have regular check-ups. For example, routine blood checks can help control inflammation and may help to pick up on potential issues before they worsen.\n\nSimple lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthily, and exercising safely, when possible, can also help you to maintain a good quality of life.\nFor people with severe COPD, treatments such as oxygen therapy, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplants may also help to increase life expectancy.\nHow do most COPD patients die?\nWith COPD, everyone’s situation and health are individual and unique, and there is no one way to say how patients may die. However, some research has found that for people with mild COPD, the causes of death are often cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIn contrast, in cases of severe COPD, research has shown that major causes of death include heart failure, respiratory failure, lung infection, lung embolism, heart arrhythmia, and lung cancer.\nWhile it’s good to stay positive and not focus on dying, if your condition gets worse and becomes very serious, it’s likely that your doctor or nurse will mention palliative and end-of-life care. Moreover, discussing your situation with your family doctor can help you make decisions and take care of your physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. As palliative care is both patient and family-centered, it can help prevent and relieve suffering.\n\nAt GAAPP, we want to empower patients because everyone deserves to live freely without their symptoms interfering with their lives.

For many patients, maximal therapy for COPD produces only modest or incomplete relief of disabling symptoms and these symptoms result in a significantly reduced quality of life.Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe COPD, many patients receive inadequate palliative care. There are several reasons for this. First, patient–physician communication about palliative and end-of-life care is infrequent and often of poor quality. Secondly, the uncertainty in predicting prognosis for patients with COPD makes communication about end-of-life care more difficult. Consequently, patients and their families frequently do not understand that severe COPD is often a progressive and terminal illness.The purpose of the present review is to summarise recent research regarding palliative and end-of-life care for patients with COPD. Recent studies provide insight and guidance into ways to improve communication about end-of-life care and thereby improve the quality of palliative and end-of-life care the patients receive. Two areas that may influence the quality of care are also highlighted: 1) the role of anxiety and depression, common problems for patients with COPD; and 2) the importance of advance care planning.Improving communication represents an important opportunity for the improvement of the quality of palliative and end-of-life care received by these patients.- Chronic bronchitis- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- communication- emphysema- end-of-life care- palliative careSERIES “COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT OF END-STAGE COPD”Edited by N. Ambrosino and R. GoldsteinNumber 6 in this SeriesChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of mortality and the 12th leading cause of disability worldwide 1, 2. By the year 2020, COPD will be the third leading cause of mortality and the fifth leading cause of disability worldwide 3–5. For many patients, maximal therapy for COPD produces only modest relief of symptoms, leaving patients with significantly reduced health-related quality of life. Many patients with COPD receive inadequate palliative care. The purpose of the present review is to examine problems in the delivery of high-quality palliative care to patients with severe COPD and to identify ways in which to address these problems. Since other articles in the series have discussed treatment of dyspnoea and other symptoms and improving quality of life, the current review will focus on communication about palliative and end-of-life care.THE DEFINITION OF PALLIATIVE AND END-OF-LIFE CAREThe goal of palliative care is to prevent and relieve suffering and to support the best possible quality of life for patients and their families, regardless of the stage of disease or the need for other therapies 6. The World Health Organization adopted the following definition of palliative care: “Palliative care means patient and family-centered care that optimizes quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering. Palliative care throughout the continuum of illness involves addressing physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual needs and to facilitate patient autonomy, access to information and choice” 7. As such, palliative care expands traditional treatment goals to include: enhancing quality of life; helping with medical decision making and identifying the goals of care; addressing the needs of family and other informal caregivers; and providing opportunities for personal growth 6. In contrast, the term “end-of-life care” usually refers to care concerning the final stage of life and focuses on care of the dying person and their family. The time period for end-of-life care is arbitrary and should be considered variable depending on the patient's trajectory of illness 8, 9. Using these definitions, palliative care includes end-of-life care, but is broader and also includes care focused on improving quality of life and minimising symptoms before the end-of-life period, as depicted in figure 1⇓. Although end-of-life care usually refers to care in the final months, weeks or days, there is growing evidence that communication with patients and families about their preferences for end-of-life care should occur early in the course of a chronic life-limiting illness, in order to facilitate high-quality palliative and end-of-life care. The present review will summarise some of this evidence, particularly as it pertains to patients with severe COPD.POOR PALLIATIVE CARE IN COPD AND THE LINK TO POOR COMMUNICATIONThe Study to Understand Prognosis and Preferences for Outcomes and Treatments (SUPPORT) enrolled seriously ill, hospitalised patients in one of five hospitals in the USA with one of nine life-limiting illnesses, including COPD 10. Compared with patients with lung cancer, patients with COPD were much more likely to die in the intensive care unit (ICU), on mechanical ventilation, and with dyspnoea 11. These differences occurred despite most patients with COPD preferring treatment focused on comfort rather than on prolonging life. In fact, SUPPORT found that patients with lung cancer and patients with COPD were equally likely to prefer not to be intubated and not to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), yet patients with COPD were much more likely to receive these therapies 11. A study in the UK also found that patients with COPD are much less likely to die at home and to receive palliative care services than patients with lung cancer 12. Additional studies have documented the poor quality of palliative care and significant burden of symptoms among patients with COPD 13. Healthcare for these patients is often initiated in response to acute exacerbations rather than being initiated proactively based on a previously developed plan for managing their disease 14. A recent study of patients with COPD or lung cancer in the US Veterans Affairs Health System also found that patients with COPD were much more likely to be admitted to an ICU, and have greater lengths of stay in the ICU during their terminal hospitalisation, than patients with lung cancer. In the same study, significant geographic variation in ICU utilisation was found for patients with COPD 15. Although variation in care may be influenced by many factors including availability, access and reimbursement issues, such geographic variation suggests a lack of consensus concerning the best approach to palliative and end-of-life care for patients with COPD. In summary, there are important opportunities for research and quality improvement if better palliative and end-of-life care is to be provided for patients with severe COPD.CHALLENGES IN PROGNOSTICATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH COPDIn COPD, it may be difficult to identify those patients who are likely to die within 6 months. The prognostic models used in SUPPORT, which were based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, documented this difficulty. These models showed that, at 5 days prior to death, patients with lung cancer were predicted to have <10% chance of surviving for 6 months, while patients with COPD were predicted to have >50% chance 11. Recent efforts to identify disease-specific prognostic models for patients with COPD do improve prognostic accuracy, but do not predict individual short-term survival as well as can be done for many patients with cancer 16–18.Therefore, uncertainty concerning prognosis plays a more prominent role in discussions of prognosis and end-of-life care for patients with COPD than for patients with cancer. As physicians have difficulty discussing prognosis in the setting of uncertainty 19, it is not surprising that they also struggle with knowing when to raise issues about end-of-life care. Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility of physicians caring for patients with severe COPD to educate them about end-of-life care and to ensure that they receive care consistent with their informed preferences for care at the end of life.Despite the uncertainty, a profile emerges of the types of patients at high risk of mortality or morbidity over the next 6 months. Physicians should be encouraged to identify patients with COPD for whom discussions about treatment preferences or end-of-life care are especially important 20. This profile could include an assessment of: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) <30% predicted; oxygen dependence; one or more hospital admissions in the previous year for an acute exacerbation of COPD; left heart failure or other comorbidities; weight loss or cachexia; decreased functional status; increasing dependence on others; and age >70 yrs (table 1⇓). The presence of two or more of these prognostic indicators should be a reason for such discussions. Multiple criteria increase the relevance and urgency for the discussion, as they increase the risk for a life-threatening exacerbation and for receiving care at the end of life that is not consistent with their informed treatment preferences.It is also important that clinicians understand patient preferences for end-of-life care and provide them with an opportunity to discuss these issues. Most patients with life-limiting illness prefer to discuss their preferences for end-of-life care relatively early in the course of their illness 21, as these discussions are less stressful when the patient is feeling relatively well. Although most patients with COPD will prefer a trial of mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, raising these issues in advance of the requirement makes it easier to revisit these discussions when patients are unwell 21, 22.CURRENT STATE OF COMMUNICATION ABOUT END-OF-LIFE CAREStudies have shown that only a minority of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD have discussed treatment preferences and end-of-life care issues with their physicians 23–25 and most believe that their physicians do not know their preferences for end-of-life care 24, 25. The current author’s group recently found that only a third of patients with oxygen-dependent COPD had discussed end-of-life care with their physicians and <25% of physicians had discussed some important aspects of end-of-life care with their patients, including talking about how long the patient might live and what dying might be like for the patient and the family 23. The study also examined the items that patients with COPD rated as being performed most poorly, which included talking about prognosis. Therefore, improved communication regarding end-of-life care, prognosis and dying needs to be targeted.A recent study by McNeely et al. 26 examined the perspectives of Canadian respirologists on communication about end-of-life care for patients with COPD. When respirologists discussed mechanical ventilation for end-stage COPD, the discussions occurred late in the disease trajectory, most commonly taking place in the ICU, with only 23% occurring in the clinic or office 26. It was found that 84% of physicians waited until dyspnoea was severe and 75% waited until the FEV1 was <30% pred. A survey of 214 general practitioners in the UK found that, although 82% felt that general practitioners should discuss the prognosis with patients with COPD, only 41% reported “often” or “always” discussing prognosis with these patients 27. Furthermore, two thirds of these physicians who reported infrequently discussing end-of-life care reported feeling inadequately prepared to have such discussions. These studies suggest that communication about end-of-life care is an important area for improvement in the care of patients with COPD.DIRECTION FOR IMPROVING COMMUNICATION ABOUT PROGNOSIS AND ABOUT END-OF-LIFE CAREThere are a number of studies that provide some specific direction for physicians in their communication about end-of-life care for patients with severe COPD. One qualitative study compared patients with severe COPD to patients with metastatic cancer or advanced AIDS, noting that patients with COPD were more likely to express concern about the lack of education that they received about their disease 28. Patients with COPD wanted more information in the following five specific areas: diagnosis and disease process, treatment, prognosis, what dying might be like, and advance care planning (table 2⇓).A qualitative study of patients with severe COPD in the UK also showed that most, but not all patients wanted more information about their prognosis 29. In a survey of older patients with serious illnesses and limited life expectancy, just over half (56%) of participants with COPD wanted to know their life expectancy 30. Often, family members may want this information even when patients do not 31. Therefore, it is important to determine how much information about prognosis patients and family members want.Expert recommendations suggest numeric expressions of risk (e.g. “eight out of 10 people will have side-effects from this drug”) generally lead to better comprehension than do qualitative expressions of risk (e.g. “this drug is very likely to cause side-effects”) 32. Moreover, since prognostic information applies to outcomes of groups of patients, experts recommend that prognostic information be phrased in terms of outcomes for populations rather than in terms of individual outcomes (e.g. “out of a group of 100 patients like your mother, I would expect about 10 to survive this”) 33. In addition, because some individuals do not wish to receive prognostic information, experts recommend the “ask-tell-ask” approach to discussing prognosis 34–36. For this approach, physicians first seek permission to discuss prognosis prior to doing so and afterwards ask patients and families their understanding of the prognosis to ensure comprehension. Table 3⇓ summarises some of these recommendations for discussing prognosis.Another area of communication that was rated as poorly performed by patients with severe COPD was asking about the patients' spiritual or religious beliefs 23. Several studies suggest that the majority of patients want to discuss spiritual or religious issues with their physicians, although some patients do not have a strong preference and others have a preference to not have such discussions with physicians 37–39. Studies from Europe suggest that physicians' religion may be an important determinant of the care patients receive 40, 41. Several reviews suggest approaches that physicians can take in determining whether patients want to discuss the patient's religion and spirituality and having these discussions with patients 42, 43, although empirical data about which specific techniques improve patient experience are limited.OVERCOMING THE BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION ABOUT END-OF-LIFE CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH COPDAn important step towards improving communication about end-of-life care is to identify the barriers to this communication and implement strategies to overcome them. A recent study of patients with oxygen-dependent COPD examined the barriers to communication about end-of-life care and noted them to be many, diverse and patient-specific 22. Although 15 barriers were identified, only two were endorsed by >50% of patients, suggesting that an individualised process is required.The two most commonly mentioned barriers were: “I'd rather concentrate on staying alive than talk about death” and “I'm not sure which physician will be taking care of me if I get very sick.” The former suggests the need for skill in talking about a difficult subject with patients who would rather not discuss it. Although many patients do not wish to discuss dying and death, these same patients often have strong opinions about CPR and mechanical ventilation 44. Among patients in SUPPORT who did not want to discuss CPR, 25% did not want to have CPR and among those who did not want to discuss mechanical ventilation, 80% did not want to have prolonged mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it may be important to have these discussions even with patients who are reluctant to do so. It may be helpful in these situations to acknowledge that discussions about dying can be difficult, but are nonetheless important for patients, families and physicians to undertake, and may provide an opportunity to decrease the burden of decision making on family members. It can also be useful to explicitly state that such a discussion will not diminish the physicians' focus on finding therapies to improve survival or quality of life, as some patients worry that such a discussion might cause a physician to “give up” on them 45. Another useful tool for raising these discussions may be to frame them in the context of “hoping for the best, while preparing for the worst” 46.The other most common barrier, “I'm not sure which physician will be taking care of me if I get very sick,” suggests that patients may fear abandonment by their physicians at the end of life and that discussions of continuity of care between physicians and patients may be an important component of discussions about dying and death. In a qualitative study of patients with severe COPD, metastatic cancer or advanced AIDS, concerns about continuity of care and abandonment emerged as important for patients with each of these diseases 21, 47.The most common physician-endorsed barriers to communication about end-of-life care 22 include: “There is too little time during our appointments to discuss everything we should”; “I worry that discussing end-of-life care will take away his/her hope”; and “The patient is not ready to talk about the care s/he wants if s/he gets sick.” These barriers suggest that interventions also need to target physicians and address systems-level issues, such as ensuring adequate time for discussions about end-of-life care. Some patients prefer a direct approach to discussing prognosis, while others prefer a more indirect approach 31. There is no relationship between the number of barriers endorsed by patients and the number endorsed by their physicians 22. This lack of an association suggests that encouraging interventions may be more successful if they target both patients and physicians.THE ROLE OF DEPRESSION AND HEALTH STATUS IN COMMUNICATION ABOUT END-OF-LIFE CAREAlthough anxiety and depression are common in COPD, they are not well recognised or treated 48–52. In a recent study, only a third of patients with COPD and clinically significant depression or anxiety were being treated and only half of those with severe depression or anxiety were being treated 53. Antidepressants can significantly improve mood among patients with COPD and depression 54. Furthermore, in patients with COPD and depression, antidepressants can also decrease ratings of dyspnoea and other physical symptoms 54.Anxiety and depression may modify patients' treatment preferences concerning end-of-life care. Patients with COPD and a higher burden of depressive symptoms have a stronger preference against CPR 55. This association is similar to findings of two prior investigations, one from SUPPORT 10 and one by Blank et al. 56, which assessed preferences for CPR, but not specifically for patients with COPD. Patients with depression are more likely to change their treatment preferences after depression resolves 57. They also rate the quality of patient–physician communication about end-of-life care significantly lower than those without depression 23. It is unclear whether this finding reflects an effect of depression on patients' ratings of the quality of communication or whether the quality of communication is negatively influenced by depression but, regardless of the reason, it is important for physicians to be aware of this relationship between depression and quality of communication about end-of-life care. Simply put, the presence of anxiety and depression may influence the patient's ability to understand the impact of decisions that they make and therefore, if possible, these symptoms should be treated prior to end-of-life decision making.Another noteworthy finding about treatment preferences was that health status, as measured by the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire, was not associated with end-of-life treatment preferences in a population of patients with severe COPD 55. These data confirm and extend the results of two prior studies performed in elderly outpatients without severe comorbidities 58 and in seriously ill, hospitalised patients with several different primary diagnoses 59. Healthcare providers should not assume that poorer health status is necessarily associated with a higher likelihood of refusing life-sustaining treatment. Since physicians consistently underestimate patients' quality of life compared with the patients' own assessments 60, 61 and since there is evidence that physicians' estimates of patients' treatment preferences are influenced by the physicians' estimates of patients' quality of life 62, it is important that physicians caring for patients with severe COPD examine their own assumptions and directly obtain treatment preferences from patients. A recent survey from Europe showed that physicians and nurses placed more value on quality of life and less value on prolonging life than patients or family members 63. Clinicians should keep this difference in mind and avoid inappropriately imposing their values on patients and their families.THE ROLE OF ADVANCE DIRECTIVES AND ADVANCE CARE PLANNING IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COPDThere has been considerable dissatisfaction with the lack of effects of advance directives on end-of-life care 64. A number of studies suggest that advance directives do not influence the treatments that patients receive 65–67 and do not change end-of-life decision making 68–70. It is clear that advance directives in the absence of good communication about end-of-life care do not improve the quality of end-of-life care. However, in the context of good communication between patients, families and physicians, advance directives may be an important component to end-of-life care. In addition, some studies suggest that the presence of advance directives are associated with decreased levels of stress and increased ratings of the quality of care among family members of dying patients 71, 72.Advance directives may be especially useful among patients with COPD because of their likely trajectory of illness, with unpredictable exacerbations that may make patients suddenly critically ill 8. In addition, some patients with COPD have strong feelings about the situations in which they would want to forego CPR or, particularly relevant for COPD, mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure. Other authors have reported on the development of COPD-specific advance directives for this purpose, although there have not been studies showing that these advance directives improve the quality of end-of-life care 73, 74. Nonetheless, advance directives are a topic that should be discussed with all patients with moderate or severe COPD as part of advance care planning and other aspects of communication about end-of-life care. For patients who have experienced noninvasive or invasive ventilation in the past, physicians have the opportunity to use patients' prior experiences as a reference point for discussing potential future episodes of acute respiratory failure and those circumstances under which they would not want these types of ventilation. Patients' prior experiences with life support, or with relatives or friends who have required life support, can be important facilitators to patient–physician communication about treatment preferences and end-of-life care 22.CARE OF THE PATIENT DYING FROM COPD AND THE ROLE OF THE HOSPICESome patients with COPD will die from lung cancer or cardiovascular disease 2, 75, whereas others die from progressive respiratory dysfunction, or a systemic complication of it 14. Physicians caring for patients dying with severe COPD may need to consider the value of treating their comorbidities in the setting of advanced and terminal COPD. For example, indications for treatment of hypertension may change as COPD advances. Physicians should consider physiological changes as patients become progressively closer to death and reassess the risks and benefits of the treatments for these comorbidities 76.Improvements in care of the dying have been largely confined to patients in hospice care and specifically to patients with cancer 77. Patients dying of progressive COPD are less likely to be offered the opportunity to benefit from hospice services when compared with patients with cancer 12. The illness trajectory among patients with COPD is more likely to be a gradual slow decline interspersed with unpredictable acute exacerbations, which are often followed by an improvement back towards, but not quite reaching, their pre-exacerbation baseline 9. This trajectory does not fit the traditional hospice model well and may be part of the reason that patients with COPD are less likely to receive hospice and palliative care services. However, understanding this trajectory and discussing it with patients and their families may offer an opportunity to adapt hospice and palliative care services to meet the needs of these patients and their families 8. Accomplishing this goal represents one of the most important challenges to improving end-of-life care for patients with severe COPD.Patients with COPD are at risk for respiratory failure and recent advances in the use of noninvasive ventilation raise questions about the use of this technology in the palliative care setting. The use of noninvasive ventilation for patients who choose to forego invasive mechanical ventilation is relatively common in Europe, with approximately one third of patients who receive end-of-life care in the hospital receiving noninvasive ventilation as the most aggressive form of ventilation before death 78. A recent Society of Critical Care Medicine Task Force provided a systematic approach to considering noninvasive ventilation in palliative care settings, and concluded that although noninvasive ventilation may be appropriate as a form of life support for patients who choose to forego invasive ventilation, current literature does not support the routine use of noninvasive ventilation for the sole purpose of palliation of symptoms 79. Furthermore, most hospice settings do not have familiarity with noninvasive ventilation and this lack of familiarity increases the risk for harm and decreases the chance of benefit from noninvasive ventilation.CONCLUSIONSIn summary, palliative care is an important component in the treatment of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is strong evidence to suggest that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receive poor-quality palliative care compared with patients with cancer 11, 12, 14. One reason these patients may receive poor-quality palliative care is that patient–physician communication about end-of-life care is unlikely to occur, or only occurs late in the illness 23–25. The quality of this communication is likely to be poor and current models for training physicians in communication about end-of-life care are inadequate 23, 27, 80. Understanding the barriers to this communication may be an important step to improving it 22. Furthermore, recognising the importance of anxiety and depression will also be important when discussing palliative and end-of-life care 55. Advance directives and good advance care planning offer an opportunity for improving the quality of palliative care received by patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Finally, hospice and palliative care services represent an important opportunity for improving end-of-life care, but clinicians caring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease must find more effective ways to utilise these services.Statement of interestNone declared.Footnotes-Previous articles in this series: No. 1: Viegi G, Pistelli F, Sherill DL, Maio S, Baldacci S, Carrozzi L.

For many patients, maximal therapy for COPD produces only modest or incomplete relief of disabling symptoms and these symptoms result in a significantly reduced quality of life.\n\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe COPD, many patients receive inadequate palliative care. There are several reasons for this. First, patient–physician communication about palliative and end-of-life care is infrequent and often of poor quality. Secondly, the uncertainty in predicting prognosis for patients with COPD makes communication about end-of-life care more difficult. Consequently, patients and their families frequently do not understand that severe COPD is often a progressive and terminal illness.\n\nThe purpose of the present review is to summarise recent research regarding palliative and end-of-life care for patients with COPD. Recent studies provide insight and guidance into ways to improve communication about end-of-life care and thereby improve the quality of palliative and end-of-life care the patients receive. Two areas that may influence the quality of care are also highlighted: 1) the role of anxiety and depression, common problems for patients with COPD; and 2) the importance of advance care planning.\n\nImproving communication represents an important opportunity for the improvement of the quality of palliative and end-of-life care received by these patients.\n- Chronic bronchitis\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n- communication\n- emphysema\n- end-of-life care\n- palliative care\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of mortality and the 12th leading cause of disability worldwide. By the year 2020, COPD will be the third leading cause of mortality and the fifth leading cause of disability worldwide. For many patients, maximal therapy for COPD produces only modest relief of symptoms, leaving patients with significantly reduced health-related quality of life. Many patients with COPD receive inadequate palliative care. The purpose of the present review is to examine problems in the delivery of high-quality palliative care to patients with severe COPD and to identify ways in which to address these problems. Since other articles in the series have discussed treatment of dyspnoea and other symptoms and improving quality of life, the current review will focus on communication about palliative and end-of-life care.\n\nTHE DEFINITION OF PALLIATIVE AND END-OF-LIFE CARE\nThe goal of palliative care is to prevent and relieve suffering and to support the best possible quality of life for patients and their families, regardless of the stage of disease or the need for other therapies. The World Health Organization adopted the following definition of palliative care: “Palliative care means patient and family-centered care that optimizes quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering. Palliative care throughout the continuum of illness involves addressing physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual needs and to facilitate patient autonomy, access to information and choice”. As such, palliative care expands traditional treatment goals to include: enhancing quality of life; helping with medical decision making and identifying the goals of care; addressing the needs of family and other informal caregivers; and providing opportunities for personal growth. In contrast, the term “end-of-life care” usually refers to care concerning the final stage of life and focuses on care of the dying person and their family. The time period for end-of-life care is arbitrary and should be considered variable depending on the patient's trajectory of illness. Using these definitions, palliative care includes end-of-life care, but is broader and also includes care focused on improving quality of life and minimising symptoms before the end-of-life period, as depicted in figure 1. Although end-of-life care usually refers to care in the final months, weeks or days, there is growing evidence that communication with patients and families about their preferences for end-of-life care should occur early in the course of a chronic life-limiting illness, in order to facilitate high-quality palliative and end-of-life care. The present review will summarise some of this evidence, particularly as it pertains to patients with severe COPD.\n\nPOOR PALLIATIVE CARE IN COPD AND THE LINK TO POOR COMMUNICATION\nThe Study to Understand Prognosis and Preferences for Outcomes and Treatments (SUPPORT) enrolled seriously ill, hospitalised patients in one of five hospitals in the USA with one of nine life-limiting illnesses, including COPD. Compared with patients with lung cancer, patients with COPD were much more likely to die in the intensive care unit (ICU), on mechanical ventilation, and with dyspnoea. These differences occurred despite most patients with COPD preferring treatment focused on comfort rather than on prolonging life. In fact, SUPPORT found that patients with lung cancer and patients with COPD were equally likely to prefer not to be intubated and not to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), yet patients with COPD were much more likely to receive these therapies. A study in the UK also found that patients with COPD are much less likely to die at home and to receive palliative care services than patients with lung cancer. Additional studies have documented the poor quality of palliative care and significant burden of symptoms among patients with COPD. Healthcare for these patients is often initiated in response to acute exacerbations rather than being initiated proactively based on a previously developed plan for managing their disease. A recent study of patients with COPD or lung cancer in the US Veterans Affairs Health System also found that patients with COPD were much more likely to be admitted to an ICU, and have greater lengths of stay in the ICU during their terminal hospitalisation, than patients with lung cancer. In the same study, significant geographic variation in ICU utilisation was found for patients with COPD. Although variation in care may be influenced by many factors including availability, access and reimbursement issues, such geographic variation suggests a lack of consensus concerning the best approach to palliative and end-of-life care for patients with COPD. In summary, there are important opportunities for research and quality improvement if better palliative and end-of-life care is to be provided for patients with severe COPD.\n\nCHALLENGES IN PROGNOSTICATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH COPD\nIn COPD, it may be difficult to identify those patients who are likely to die within 6 months. The prognostic models used in SUPPORT, which were based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, documented this difficulty. These models showed that, at 5 days prior to death, patients with lung cancer were predicted to have <10% chance of surviving for 6 months, while patients with COPD were predicted to have >50% chance. Recent efforts to identify disease-specific prognostic models for patients with COPD do improve prognostic accuracy, but do not predict individual short-term survival as well as can be done for many patients with cancer.\n\nTherefore, uncertainty concerning prognosis plays a more prominent role in discussions of prognosis and end-of-life care for patients with COPD than for patients with cancer. As physicians have difficulty discussing prognosis in the setting of uncertainty, it is not surprising that they also struggle with knowing when to raise issues about end-of-life care. Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility of physicians caring for patients with severe COPD to educate them about end-of-life care and to ensure that they receive appropriate palliative and end-of-life care.\n\n""}]","While Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not always classified as ""terminal"" at the point of diagnosis, it is a progressive, incurable lung disease that significantly impacts quality of life and can lead to life-limiting complications, particularly in its advanced stages. Many medical professionals and organizations consider advanced COPD to be a life-limiting or terminal illness due to its progressive nature and high mortality rate in later stages.

""COPD is a chronic, progressive disease that, while manageable, often leads to a decline in lung function over time. In its severe forms, it absolutely becomes a life-limiting illness, and palliative care is crucial for managing symptoms and improving comfort,"" states Dr. David Mannino, a leading pulmonologist and medical director for the COPD Foundation. This highlights the serious and often fatal trajectory of the disease.

Globally, COPD remains a significant health burden. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COPD was responsible for 3.23 million deaths in 2019, making it the third leading cause of death worldwide. This statistic underscores its serious and often fatal nature in later stages, emphasizing why it is frequently considered a terminal illness.

Patients with advanced COPD often experience severe breathlessness, chronic cough, and frequent exacerbations, which can necessitate hospitalization and significantly shorten lifespan. While treatments can help manage symptoms and slow progression, there is currently no cure, and the disease can ultimately lead to respiratory failure.

Transactions are broadcast to all network participants—creating an unalterable transaction log.Blockchain is built on technology, where multiple copies of data exist across a network, rather than a single server or database.

The decentralized management allows for faster, less costly processing of transactions, while also allowing untrusted participants to reach consensus on the state of the database.Types of BlockchainBeyond the foundational technology, blockchain is categorized in two spectrums: public blockchain, and permissioned blockchain. A public blockchain is a transparent ledger of transactional activity that happens in a given network. The network is open, and anyone can run the open-source software on their computer to join the network. Due to the large scale of the network, agreeing on the state of the ledger can be time consuming and often energy intensive. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether utilize a public blockchain for transferring value and recording ownership.Alternately, a permissioned blockchain has an owner, typically a utility, company or consortium of enterprises. Select participants must be authorized to join the network, which has a unique algorithm for reaching consensus on the state of the ledger. The network is often faster than public blockchains. An example of a permissioned blockchain is Quorum. The Quorum platform was developed by J.P. Morgan, and uses blockchain technology to process private transactions.The Benefits of BlockchainBlockchain could potentially disrupt traditional business models and automate certain processes, so businesses can redeploy resources toward more value-generating endeavors.

The research is part of an overarching thesis on blockchain security and vulnerabilities. In a recent Wall Street Journal blog post, Madnick wrote that the breaches range in losses from $12,000 to as much as $600 million.“In total, the publicly reported losses by cyberattacks against blockchain systems during the past eight years exceed $1 billion,” Madnick wrote in the post.The hope, Madnick said, is not to diminish blockchain’s benefits, but rather encourage caution around the newly mainstream technology.“It’s not just whether it’s breakable or not, but whether it can be misused,” Madnick said. “The trouble is blockchain itself is just a piece of data; it doesn’t do anything. It’s the software and the use of the software that makes the blockchain useful. Blockchain itself might be secure, but the use of the blockchain is where all of these weaknesses come through.”Here are three blockchain advantages, and the risks that go with them.Distributed controlBlockchain doesn’t have a central database. Instead, it’s run on hundreds of thousands of servers. If one of those servers stops, the others keep running.“In that sense, distributed also means unstoppable,” Madnick said.But a lack of an on/off switch can cause problems. In 2017, hackers found a coding flaw in the Ethereum blockchain platform, and used it to siphon away millions of dollars. Watchdogs realized what was going on, Madnick said, but weren’t able to shut down or disconnect the system. Instead, white-hat hackers used the same coding bug to steal the remaining money faster than the criminals, and redistribute it.In a similar vein, because the software that drives blockchain is publicly available [and how it’s replicated on thousands of servers around the world], someone with bad intentions might exploit a software flaw they find before anyone else notices and fixes it.AnonymityAccessing a blockchain account requires a key. This key is a long combination of numbers and letters and is nearly impossible to guess. The key is also anonymized, so no one knows the identity of the key holder, Madnick said.Unlike a safety deposit box at a brick-and-mortar bank — which in the case of a lost key could be identified by the owner and pried open with a crowbar — if someone loses their blockchain key, that account can never be accessed again.ImmutabilityBlockchain is used in a variety of industries, but what will happen if and when it’s used to record something a person would rather not have around forever?What if blockchain is used for criminal records, Madnick suggested, and someone wants their record expunged? On a blockchain, that history will permanently follow the person.And what about the General Data Protection Regulation, the European Union’s effort to give individuals more control of their personal data. A person living in one of the EU countries has the right to request that that information be erased if it is no longer needed. How can someone be erased if nothing can be removed from blockchain, Madnick asked.“[Immutability] is what I would call an unexpected consequence,” Madnick said. “Which for certain people may be viewed as a negative unexpected consequence.”Earlier this year child pornography images were found in the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) ledger. The images appeared on a website which allows people to see content added to the BSV ledger. The browser was shut down, and a filter put in place, but actually removing the content from the ledger would require agreement among all of the blockchain servers — which is no small feat.Blockchain stakeholders are working on ways to prevent future instances of abusing blockchain technology, but in the meantime, Madnick said he wants current and potential users to build up caution for the relatively new technology.“I’m not trying to diminish the fact these are great advantages it’s just that these advantages have consequences as well,” Madnick said. “These are all great things but also be aware of the ways in which they could be abused and either A) minimize the likelihood of being abused or B) decide the risk of them being abused is small enough that you’re willing to tolerate it.”', 'url': 'https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/risks-and-unintended-consequences-blockchain', 'cleaned_text': '# The risks and unintended consequences of blockchain\nBlockchain technology is anonymous, distributed, permanent, and widely touted as unbreakably secure. But those qualities are also the source for some of blockchain’s greatest weaknesses, and with the technology gaining popularity and acceptance as a solution to just about everything, it’s important to be cautious before jumping on the bandwagon.\n\n“Blockchain has a lot of great advantages to it, but sometimes those advantages can be misused in ways that often have not been thought about,” said Stuart Madnick, MIT Sloan professor of information technologies.\nMadnick and Jae Hyung Lee, SM’19, are releasing a study on 72 publicly reported blockchain security breaches between 2011 and 2018. The research is part of an overarching thesis on blockchain security and vulnerabilities. In a recent Wall Street Journal blog post, Madnick wrote that the breaches range in losses from $12,000 to as much as $600 million.\n\n“In total, the publicly reported losses by cyberattacks against blockchain systems during the past eight years exceed $1 billion,” Madnick wrote in the post.\nThe hope, Madnick said, is not to diminish blockchain’s benefits, but rather encourage caution around the newly mainstream technology.\n“It’s not just whether it’s breakable or not, but whether it can be misused,” Madnick said. “The trouble is blockchain itself is just a piece of data; it doesn’t do anything. It’s the software and the use of the software that makes the blockchain useful. Blockchain itself might be secure, but the use of the blockchain is where all of these weaknesses come through.”\n\nHere are three blockchain advantages, and the risks that go with them.\n## Distributed control\nBlockchain doesn’t have a central database. Instead, it’s run on hundreds of thousands of servers. If one of those servers stops, the others keep running.\n\n“In that sense, distributed also means unstoppable,” Madnick said.\nBut a lack of an on/off switch can cause problems. In 2017, hackers found a coding flaw in the Ethereum blockchain platform, and used it to siphon away millions of dollars. Watchdogs realized what was going on, Madnick said, but weren’t able to shut down or disconnect the system. Instead, white-hat hackers used the same coding bug to steal the remaining money faster than the criminals, and redistribute it.\n\nIn a similar vein, because the software that drives blockchain is publicly available [and how it’s replicated on thousands of servers around the world], someone with bad intentions might exploit a software flaw they find before anyone else notices and fixes it.\n## Anonymity\nAccessing a blockchain account requires a key. This key is a long combination of numbers and letters and is nearly impossible to guess. The key is also anonymized, so no one knows the identity of the key holder, Madnick said.\n\nUnlike a safety deposit box at a brick-and-mortar bank — which in the case of a lost key could be identified by the owner and pried open with a crowbar — if someone loses their blockchain key, that account can never be accessed again.\n## Immutability\nBlockchain is used in a variety of industries, but what will happen if and when it’s used to record something a person would rather not have around forever?\nWhat if blockchain is used for criminal records, Madnick suggested, and someone wants their record expunged? On a blockchain, that history will permanently follow the person.\n\nAnd what about the General Data Protection Regulation, the European Union’s effort to give individuals more control of their personal data. A person living in one of the EU countries has the right to request that that information be erased if it is no longer needed. How can someone be erased if nothing can be removed from blockchain, Madnick asked.\n\n“[Immutability] is what I would call an unexpected consequence,” Madnick said. “Which for certain people may be viewed as a negative unexpected consequence.”\n\nEarlier this year child pornography images were found in the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) ledger. The images appeared on a website which allows people to see content added to the BSV ledger. The browser was shut down, and a filter put in place, but actually removing the content from the ledger would require agreement among all of the blockchain servers — which is no small feat.\n\nBlockchain stakeholders are working on ways to prevent future instances of abusing blockchain technology, but in the meantime, Madnick said he wants current and potential users to build up caution for the relatively new technology.\n“I’m not trying to diminish the fact these are great advantages it’s just that these advantages have consequences as well,” Madnick said. “These are all great things but also be aware of the ways in which they could be abused and either A) minimize the likelihood of being abused or B) decide the risk of them being abused is small enough that you’re willing to tolerate it.”\n\n'}, {'raw_text': ""The technology most likely to change the next decade of business is not the social web, big data, the cloud, robotics, or even artificial intelligence.

AT&T does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.The future of finance is being reshaped by blockchain technology. This revolutionary technology has the potential to revolutionize how people and businesses interact with money, from offering greater transparency and better security to faster speeds and lower costs.In this article, we look at eight key impacts that blockchain technology has had on the future of financial services. From smart contracts to decentralized finance, these developments are set to change the face of finance in the years ahead. Read on for an overview of how blockchain technology will shape our economic landscape soon.- The potential to revolutionize paymentsOne of the most significant impacts of blockchain technology on the future of finance is its potential to revolutionize payments. Blockchain-based payment systems enable secure and transparent transactions without the use of third-party intermediaries, reducing transaction fees and time delays.What this means, from a macro perspective, is that blockchain-based payments have the potential to drastically reduce costs of cross-border transactions, making them more accessible and efficient. Additionally, these systems can improve the accuracy and reliability of payment processing by helping to eliminate fraud and human error in financial operations.- Improved asset security and managementBlockchain also has the potential to improve asset security and management. One example of this is smart contracts, which enable automated payments based on predetermined conditions. Smart contracts can help to reduce fraud by automatically executing conditions that both parties have agreed upon, reducing the risk of human error or malicious intent.Moreover, blockchain-based solutions offer improved transparency when it comes to monitoring the ownership and transfer of assets. This helps ensure accuracy in financial transactions while providing an additional layer of security against theft or tampering with documents.- Streamlined financial processesThe implementation of blockchain technology can also streamline existing financial processes. For instance, complex reconciliation tasks such as matching payments to invoices can be automated, reducing the time and resources needed to complete the task.In addition, blockchain-based solutions can be used to facilitate the exchange of data between different financial systems, providing an improved overview of a company’s finances. This could help to reduce manual errors and improve decision-making processes by providing a more comprehensive view of financial performance.- Greater access to banking servicesAnother major benefit of blockchain technology is its potential to increase access to banking services, especially in developing countries where traditional banking infrastructure remains limited or nonexistent. By eliminating many of the current barriers associated with opening bank accounts, blockchain-based banking solutions have the potential to open new economic opportunities for those who have previously been excluded from participating in the global financial system.Furthermore, blockchain-based solutions can also be used to provide access to non-traditional banking services such as microfinance and lending. This could prove particularly beneficial for small businesses and entrepreneurs who may not have had access to these types of services in the past.Overall, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the future of finance by providing increased security, efficiency, and accessibility when it comes to financial transactions. As more companies embrace this technology, we can expect to see further innovation and disruption in the industry moving forward.- Improved transparencyThe adoption of blockchain technology promises improved transparency when it comes to financial transactions. Other than just payment processing, blockchain-based systems can be used to monitor and track assets, ownership, transfers, and more. This helps ensure accuracy in financial transactions while providing an additional layer of security against theft or tampering with documents.Furthermore, the transparency provided by blockchain technology can help promote trust between parties involved in a financial transaction. The immutability of records on the distributed ledger allows users to verify that information has not been tampered with, leading to greater confidence when engaging in digital transactions.- Increased protection against cyberattacksOne of the biggest advantages of blockchain technology is its ability to improve cybersecurity. Its decentralized structure and cryptographic protocols provide an added level of protection against malicious actors attempting to gain access to sensitive data. Additionally, its distributed ledger ensures that all users have access to a shared version of the database, eliminating any risk of data breaches due to single points of failure.The enhanced security provided by blockchain technology could prove invaluable in protecting financial information from cybercriminals and reducing the chances of costly data breaches.- Lower costs for businessesThe implementation of blockchain technology can also help reduce operational costs for businesses. By removing the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processors when conducting transactions, companies can save on transaction fees and other associated costs. This is particularly beneficial for small businesses who may not have had access to traditional banking services in the past.In addition, blockchain-based solutions can also be used to streamline processes such as accounting and auditing, reducing the time and money spent on manual processes. This could lead to further cost savings for businesses in the long run.- Smart contractsSmart contracts are one of the most promising applications of blockchain technology. These digital agreements enable two or more parties to enter into a contractual agreement without needing a middleman or third party. The contract is then stored on the distributed ledger, ensuring that it cannot be modified or tampered with once it has been agreed upon.Smart contracts can also be programmed with specific conditions that must be met before they can be executed, making them ideal for use in complex financial transactions where trust between all parties involved is required. This could lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and less risk of fraud or malicious activities.Overall, the potential applications of blockchain technology in finance are vast and varied. The technology has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing increased security, transparency, efficiency, and accessibility when it comes to digital transactions. This can prove particularly beneficial for small businesses who may not have had access to traditional banking services in the past. As more companies embrace this technology moving forward, we can expect to see further innovation and disruption in the field of finance.ConclusionOverall, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the financial sector by providing increased security, transparency, efficiency and accessibility when it comes to digital transactions. This can lead to reduced costs for businesses, improved cybersecurity measures and smart contracts that enable secure agreements between parties.As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see further innovation and disruption in the field of finance.

It is the first rear mid-engine Corvette since the model\'s introduction in 1953, differing from the traditional front mid-engine design started in 1963. The C8 was announced in April 2019, and the coupe made its official debut on July 18, 2019, in Tustin, California. The convertible made its debut in October 2019 during a media event at the Kennedy Space Center to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. The racing version, the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R, also made its debut that same month.[8] Production officially began on February 3, 2020, delayed by the 2019 General Motors strike.[1]Overview[edit]Following several experimental CERV prototype vehicles, the C8 is GM\'s first production rear mid-engine sports car since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued. It features a vastly different design from previous Corvettes, with an all-new aluminum architecture and coil-over springs in place of leaf springs used on prior models. The exterior features more aggressive aerodynamics including larger air intakes and prominent side scoops. A trunk is located at the rear, with additional storage space at the front of the car. Combined, these provide 13 cubic feet (370 L) of cargo space, 2 cubic feet (57 L) less than that of the C7.[9] As a result of the switch to a mid-engine layout, the passenger cell has been shifted forward by 16.5 inches (420 mm).[10] The cockpit has been designed to be driver-centric, with numerous controls mounted on the center console as well as utilizing a new hexagonal steering wheel. A 12 in (30.5 cm) digital screen replaces the instrument cluster and reflects one of the six driving modes selected, and is accompanied by an 8 in (20.3 cm) touchscreen. A special Z button (a homage to Zora Arkus-Duntov ""Father of the Corvette"") is also mounted on the steering wheel; this can quickly activate customized performance settings.[11]-Corvette C8 Convertible-InteriorStingray[edit]Trim levels and options[edit]Three trim levels are currently available, 1LT, 2LT and 3LT, augmented by three suspension setups, FE1, FE3 and FE4 which correspond with the two Z51 Performance packages. In addition, three seat options are also available: GT1, GT2 and Competition Sport. The interior is upholstered in leather, microsuede or performance textile with carbon fiber or aluminum trims. A Performance Data Recorder has been upgraded with a higher resolution camera as well as a new interface. GM\'s virtual camera mirror is optional, which projects video from the backup camera onto the rear view mirror.[12][13]Engine[edit]The Stingray uses a new version of the LS-based GM small-block engine derived from the C7 Stingray\'s LT1, now called the LT2.[14] The new naturally aspirated 6.2 L V8 is rated at 490 hp (365 kW; 497 PS) at 6,450 rpm and 465 lb⋅ft (630 N⋅m) of torque at 5,150 rpm, an improvement of 40 hp (30 kW; 41 PS) and 10 lb⋅ft (14 N⋅m) over the outgoing C7 Corvette Stingray.[15] The engine uses dry sump lubrication system.[16] Like the C7, the C8 features Active Fuel Management, or cylinder deactivation, which is used when the car is subjected to low load scenarios such as highway cruising.[17][18]The engine has two radiators, one on each side in the front. The Z51 package includes a third radiator, a water-to-water and water-to-oil radiator on the rear driver\'s side, cooling both engine oil and transmission lubricant, taking air in through the rear quarter panel opening.[19]The optional NPP sport exhaust system brings the total power output to 495 hp (369 kW; 502 PS) and torque to 470 lb⋅ft (637 N⋅m).[20] Chevrolet claims that the C8 can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.9 seconds when equipped with the optional Z51 package;[12] Car and Driver recorded a time of 2.8 seconds (by subtracting a 1-foot rollout).[21]Transmission[edit]The Stingray is only offered with an 8-speed dual-clutch automated transmission[22] made by Tremec, with paddle shifters on the steering wheel.[23] No manual transmission option is available. The only other model years not offered with a manual transmission were the 1953–1954 C1 and the 1982 C3.[12][24]Suspension[edit]The base model of the Stingray comes with unequal length double wishbone suspension at the front and rear axles made from forged aluminum.[25] Monotube shock absorbers are standard at all four wheels. The car can be equipped with a front-axle lifting height adjustable suspension system that can add 2 in (40 mm) of ground clearance at speeds under 25 mph (40 km/h).[26]The Z51 package adds a performance-tuned adjustable suspension with higher front and rear spring rates and firmer dampers.[27] The front shocks, on vehicles without hydraulic front lift, and the rear shocks, have threaded spring seats that allow adjustment of the preload on the coil springs.[28] Additionally, the spring seat can be adjusted approximately 20 mm (0.8 in) up or down from the nominal position.[28]Magnetic Selective Ride Control is an available option for all trims and levels. On Z51 equipped Corvettes, Magnetic Selective Ride Control includes Performance Traction Management and electronic limited-slip differential (eLSD).[29]Wheels[edit]The Stingray is equipped with 19 in (48 cm) (front) and 20 in (51 cm) (rear) alloy wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport ALS tires, with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires available as a part of the Z51 performance package. All-season tires are used on base models for better grip.[30] The exact tire dimensions are 245/35ZR-19 at the front and 305/30ZR-20 at the rear.[12] The standard brakes are four-piston Brembo ventilated discs with diameters of 12.6 in (320 mm) at the front and 13.6 in (345 mm) at the rear. The Z51 package provides upgraded and enlarged brakes measuring 13.3 in (338 mm) at the front and 13.8 in (351 mm) at the rear.[25]Technology[edit]The C8 Corvette debuted with an 8-inch infotainment screen in a driver centric cockpit. It comes standard with Chevrolet\'s Infotainment 3 Plus system. Standard features include Bluetooth connectivity, 4G hotspot, and both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Higher trims are equipped with a 14-speaker Bose audio system and navigation options. Additional technology features include a performance data recorder package for 2LT and 3LT trim levels as well as a camera based rear view mirror.[31] The 2020 Corvette was the first year Chevrolet introduced over the air updates to the Corvette line-up. This allows Chevrolet to send updates to the vehicle remotely. Chevrolet used this capability to resolve a front trunk recall for the 2020 Corvettes.[32]Right-hand-drive (RHD)[edit]For the first time since the 1953 introduction of the Corvette (C1), the current generation Corvette is offered in right-hand-drive configuration for the Australian, New Zealand, Japanese, and UK markets.[33][34] The Corvette (C8) is General Motors\' only RHD vehicle to be assembled in the factory rather than converted from left-hand-drive. After the pre-sale announcement, 300 RHD Corvettes were sold within sixty hours: a record for the Corvette sales in Japan and three times the annual sales number for its left-hand-drive predecessor.[35] The introduction of RHD Corvette for Australian market was delayed to the middle of 2021 due to the reorganization of Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) into GMSV (General Motors Special Vehicles) which also brings GM vehicles into New Zealand. Only 200 RHD Corvettes will be sold in Australia per year, and the price is set at $149,990 AUD with higher performance versions above $200,000 AUD. The first sales of the RHD C8 in New Zealand were 28 cars in 2022.[36][37]Z06[edit]The performance version of the Corvette, the Z06, was unveiled on October 26, 2021. The Z06 entered production as a 2023 model year as a homologation vehicle.[38]Trim levels and options[edit]The Z06 has three trim levels adding various interior comfort and technology upgrades: 1LZ, 2LZ, and 3LZ. Additionally, the Z07 Performance Package can be applied to any trim that adds improved brakes, carbon fiber aerodynamic elements, suspension tuning, and performance tires.[39]Engine[edit]The Z06 uses a new naturally aspirated 5.5 L V8 producing 670 hp (500 kW; 679 PS) at 8,400 rpm, 460 lb⋅ft (624 N⋅m) of torque at 6,300 rpm and has a redline of 8,600 rpm.[40][41] This engine, dubbed the LT6, features a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) and a flat-plane crank, and surpasses the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Black Series\' M159 engine to become the most powerful naturally aspirated production V8.[42] A modified version of this engine has powered the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R since 2019, and many features in the racing engine carry over to the road engine.[43] Other features of this new engine include a cast aluminum block, dual coil valve springs supporting titanium intake & sodium filled exhaust valves, forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium connecting rods, active split intake manifold with twin 87mm throttle bodies, four-into-two-into-one stainless steel exhaust headers, and a factory six-stage 10-quart dry sump oiling system with individual crank bay scavenging.[41] A feature the LT6 shares with other Chevrolet small blocks is the bore spacing of 4.4 inches.[41][43]Transmission[edit]The Z06 uses the same 8-speed dual-clutch transmission used by Stingray models, albeit with a shorter 5.56:1 final drive ratio for improved acceleration. Chevrolet claims this allows the Z06 to accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 2.6 seconds.[44]Suspension[edit]The Z06 features the same basic suspension setup as the Stingray, however the electronic limited-slip differential and magnetic ride adaptive suspension system are now standard for all Z06 trims. The Z07 Performance Package includes the FE7 track-oriented suspension setup.[39]Wheels[edit]The Z06\'s body has been widened to accommodate larger wheels and thicker tires. The wheels have diameters of 20 inches (51 cm) at the front and 21 inches (53 cm) at the rear, and are available with standard alloy or optional carbon fiber rims. The tires have dimensions of 275/30ZR20 at the front and 345/25ZR21 at the rear, and the Z07 Performance Package comes standard with Michelin Cup 2 R ZP performance tires.[45] Chevrolet claims that the optional carbon fiber wheels, supplied by Australian manufacturer Carbon Revolution,[46] shave off 41 lb (19 kg) of unsprung weight.[47]Aerodynamics[edit]The base Z06 comes with a front splitter and a rear spoiler. Under the splitter are stall gurneys to reduce drag.[48] Included with the rear spoiler is an installable fixed Gurney flap, which when installed produces 365 lb (166 kg) pounds more downforce at 300 km/h (186 mph). The Z07 carbon fiber performance package adds a larger front-splitter, front corner canards (dive planes), a pedestal mounted rear wing, and underbody aero strakes, and removes the stall gurneys under the splitter for additional downforce.[41] Chevrolet claims that with all these equipped and in the track configuration, the Z06 is capable of 1.22g lateral acceleration on a skidpad.[41][49]Performance[edit]Chevrolet claims a 10.6-second quarter-mile time for the Z06 model when equipped with the Z07 package. The C8 Z06 is able to reach top speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour (320 km/h).[50]E-Ray[edit]The performance hybrid version of the Corvette, the E-Ray, was unveiled on January 17, 2023. The E-Ray will enter production as a 2024 model year and will be the quickest Corvette ever made as well as the first with all wheel drive and the first hybrid.[51]Trim levels and options[edit]The E-Ray has three trim levels adding various interior comfort and technology upgrades: 1LZ, 2LZ, and 3LZ. Additionally, there will be a ZER Performance Package that can be applied to any trim and It will include summer only tires as well as chassis tuning. The E-Ray will come standard with Carbon Ceramic brakes and an eAWD drivetrain.[52]Performance[edit]Chevrolet claims a 10.5-second quarter-mile time and a 0-60 time of 2.5 seconds making it the quickest Corvette to date in those categories.Modes[edit]Stealth Mode allows for all-electric driving at a maximum speed of 45 mph. Designed for quietly leaving the neighborhood. [53]Model year changes[edit]2020 model year[edit]The first production model of the C8 Corvette was the Stingray with a new mid-mounted 6.2 L LT2 V8 engine. It was available as a 2-door targa top or a retractable hardtop convertible. The targa top was available in body color, transparent, or visible carbon fiber.2021 model year[edit]Trim levels and options[edit]2021 saw a list of changes following the 2020 launch year of the C8 Corvette. Long Beach Red Metallic Tintcoat and Blade Silver Metallic were retired. Red Mist Metallic Tintcoat and Silver Flare Metallic were added as premium color options. Additionally, full length racing stripes saw 4 new color options.[54]The interior saw the addition of Sky Cool Gray / Strike Yellow color available only on the 3LT.[55] Magnetic Ride became available separate to the Z51 package for the 2021 model year. The Z51 package saw a price increase from $5,000 to $5,995 starting 2021. The front lift saw an increase from $1,495 to $1,995 as well.[56]Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto became standard options in 2021. Black Trident Spoke wheels, all weather floor liners, and carbon fiber mirror covers all saw minor price increases as well.[57]The 2021 C8 received a base price increase, mid way through the production cycle. Chevrolet raised the base price by $1000, putting it over the $60,000 threshold. The price increase was effective for all orders entered after March 1, 2021. The increase was attributed to a fluctuation in supplier parts costs as well as the global chip shortage which has delayed production in the automotive sector as a whole.[58]The end of the 2021 production year also saw the end of Sebring Orange, Shadow Gray, and Zeus Bronze as exterior color options.[59]Production[edit]The 2021 Corvette started production on December 8, 2020, due to extended production of the 2020 model year.[60] The 2021 model year saw production issues due to parts constraints.[61] Chevrolet also increased the base price of the Corvette by $1,000 in the middle of the 2021 model year, to $60,995.[62]2022 model year[edit]The LT2 saw fuel management system upgrades for the 2022 model year which featured a new fuel pump and injectors. The base price was also increased $1200 to compensate for increased supplier costs. A new IMSA GTLM Championship Edition package, limited to 1000 units, was introduced for 2022.[63]The 2022 model year saw the introduction of Caffeine Metallic, Amplify Orange Tintcoat, and Hypersonic Gray as new color options.[64]2023 model year[edit]GM and Chevrolet started production of the 2023 model year in the spring of 2022. 2023 saw multiple price increases early into the production year. In March, it was announced that the 2023 model year would see a $1000 base price increase. In May, the destination charge saw a minor $100 increase. During the start of production and launch of the 2023 configurator, GM raised the base price of the 2023 Corvette by $2300 making the new base price $65,595.[65][66] Several packages and options saw increases and adjustment to pricing.2023 also received a special edition variation of the Corvette to commemorate its 70th anniversary since the launch of the Corvette model. The 2023 Corvette Stingray 70th Anniversary Edition is a $5995 package atop the 3LT trim level. The special edition was offered in two exclusive colors of White Pearl Metallic Tri-Coat and Carbon Flash Metallic. Additionally, the package came with special wheels, badging, and VIN sequence to commemorate the vehicle\'s 70th year in the US market.[67]In addition to changes to the base Corvette, the Corvette Z06 was introduced with a 5.5 L LT6 V8 engine.[40]2024 model year[edit]The 2024 Corvette started production in the summer of 2023. The base price of the standard C8 went up from $64,500 to $66,300 (an increase of $1800), whereas the price of the C8 Z06 went up from $105,300 to $108,100 (an increase of $2800) No limited edition packages have been added, however some additional options have. For example, more carbon fiber elements (such as a carb fiber high wing and door mirror caps) have been added to the 2LT trim, a new carbon fiber spoiler styled after the Z06 high wing is now available for the base C8, and carbon fiber wheels with a red trim are now available as a top end option for the Z06.As of Summer 2023, the brand new hybrid Corvette C8 E-ray is now available, starting at $102,900.Production[edit]|Model Year|Stingray|Total|Coupe|Conv.|2020[68]|16,787|3,581|20,368|2021[69]|15,112|11,104|26,216|2022[70]|13,451|12,380|25,831Awards[edit]The Corvette C8 was named 2020 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[71] and was also featured on 2020 Car and Driver 10Best.[72] The C8 was also named 2020 North American Car of the Year,[73] 2020 Detroit Free Press Car of the Year,[74] and 2020 MotorWeek Drivers\' Choice Best of the Year.[75]References[edit]- ^ a b ""C8 Corvette Production Now Officially Underway"".

Retrieved April 25, 2022.', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C8)', 'cleaned_text': 'The Chevrolet Corvette (C8) is the eighth generation of the Corvette sports car manufactured by American automobile manufacturer Chevrolet. It is the first rear mid-engine Corvette since the model\'s introduction in 1953, differing from the traditional front mid-engine design started in 1963. The C8 was announced in April 2019, and the coupe made its official debut on July 18, 2019, in Tustin, California. The convertible made its debut in October 2019 during a media event at the Kennedy Space Center to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. The racing version, the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R, also made its debut that same month. Production officially began on February 3, 2020, delayed by the 2019 General Motors strike.\n\nFollowing several experimental CERV prototype vehicles, the C8 is GM\'s first production rear mid-engine sports car since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued. It features a vastly different design from previous Corvettes, with an all-new aluminum architecture and coil-over springs in place of leaf springs used on prior models. The exterior features more aggressive aerodynamics including larger air intakes and prominent side scoops. A trunk is located at the rear, with additional storage space at the front of the car. Combined, these provide 13 cubic feet (370 L) of cargo space, 2 cubic feet (57 L) less than that of the C7. As a result of the switch to a mid-engine layout, the passenger cell has been shifted forward by 16.5 inches (420 mm). The cockpit has been designed to be driver-centric, with numerous controls mounted on the center console as well as utilizing a new hexagonal steering wheel. A 12 in (30.5 cm) digital screen replaces the instrument cluster and reflects one of the six driving modes selected, and is accompanied by an 8 in (20.3 cm) touchscreen. A special Z button (a homage to Zora Arkus-Duntov ""Father of the Corvette"") is also mounted on the steering wheel; this can quickly activate customized performance settings.\n\nTrim levels and options\nThree trim levels are currently available, 1LT, 2LT and 3LT, augmented by three suspension setups, FE1, FE3 and FE4 which correspond with the two Z51 Performance packages. In addition, three seat options are also available: GT1, GT2 and Competition Sport. The interior is upholstered in leather, microsuede or performance textile with carbon fiber or aluminum trims. A Performance Data Recorder has been upgraded with a higher resolution camera as well as a new interface. GM\'s virtual camera mirror is optional, which projects video from the backup camera onto the rear view mirror.\n\nEngine\nThe Stingray uses a new version of the LS-based GM small-block engine derived from the C7 Stingray\'s LT1, now called the LT2. The new naturally aspirated 6.2 L V8 is rated at 490 hp (365 kW; 497 PS) at 6,450 rpm and 465 lb⋅ft (630 N⋅m) of torque at 5,150 rpm, an improvement of 40 hp (30 kW; 41 PS) and 10 lb⋅ft (14 N⋅m) over the outgoing C7 Corvette Stingray. The engine uses dry sump lubrication system. Like the C7, the C8 features Active Fuel Management, or cylinder deactivation, which is used when the car is subjected to low load scenarios such as highway cruising.\n\nThe engine has two radiators, one on each side in the front. The Z51 package includes a third radiator, a water-to-water and water-to-oil radiator on the rear driver\'s side, cooling both engine oil and transmission lubricant, taking air in through the rear quarter panel opening.\n\nThe optional NPP sport exhaust system brings the total power output to 495 hp (369 kW; 502 PS) and torque to 470 lb⋅ft (637 N⋅m). Chevrolet claims that the C8 can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.9 seconds when equipped with the optional Z51 package; Car and Driver recorded a time of 2.8 seconds (by subtracting a 1-foot rollout).\n\nTransmission\nThe Stingray is only offered with an 8-speed dual-clutch automated transmission made by Tremec, with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. No manual transmission option is available. The only other model years not offered with a manual transmission were the 1953–1954 C1 and the 1982 C3.\n\nSuspension\nThe base model of the Stingray comes with unequal length double wishbone suspension at the front and rear axles made from forged aluminum. Monotube shock absorbers are standard at all four wheels. The car can be equipped with a front-axle lifting height adjustable suspension system that can add 2 in (40 mm) of ground clearance at speeds under 25 mph (40 km/h).\n\nThe Z51 package adds a performance-tuned adjustable suspension with higher front and rear spring rates and firmer dampers. The front shocks, on vehicles without hydraulic front lift, and the rear shocks, have threaded spring seats that allow adjustment of the preload on the coil springs. Additionally, the spring seat can be adjusted approximately 20 mm (0.8 in) up or down from the nominal position.\n\nMagnetic Selective Ride Control is an available option for all trims and levels. On Z51 equipped Corvettes, Magnetic Selective Ride Control includes Performance Traction Management and electronic limited-slip differential (eLSD).\n\nWheels\nThe Stingray is equipped with 19 in (48 cm) (front) and 20 in (51 cm) (rear) alloy wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport ALS tires, with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires available as a part of the Z51 performance package. All-season tires are used on base models for better grip. The exact tire dimensions are 245/35ZR-19 at the front and 305/30ZR-20 at the rear. The standard brakes are four-piston Brembo ventilated discs with diameters of 12.6 in (320 mm) at the front and 13.6 in (345 mm) at the rear. The Z51 package provides upgraded and enlarged brakes measuring 13.3 in (338 mm) at the front and 13.8 in (351 mm) at the rear.\n\nTechnology\nThe C8 Corvette debuted with an 8-inch infotainment screen in a driver centric cockpit. It comes standard with Chevrolet\'s Infotainment 3 Plus system. Standard features include Bluetooth connectivity, 4G hotspot, and both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Higher trims are equipped with a 14-speaker Bose audio system and navigation options. Additional technology features include a performance data recorder package for 2LT and 3LT trim levels as well as a camera based rear view mirror. The 2020 Corvette was the first year Chevrolet introduced over the air updates to the Corvette line-up. This allows Chevrolet to send updates to the vehicle remotely. Chevrolet used this capability to resolve a front trunk recall for the 2020 Corvettes.\n\nRight-hand-drive (RHD)\nFor the first time since the 1953 introduction of the Corvette (C1), the current generation Corvette is offered in right-hand-drive configuration.'}, {'raw_text': ""With 2020 Corvette reviews flooding in, we're learning a lot about the bowtie brand's first mid-engined sports car.

It is the first rear mid-engine Corvette since the model\'s introduction in 1953, differing from the traditional front mid-engine design started in 1963. The C8 was announced in April 2019, and the coupe made its official debut on July 18, 2019, in Tustin, California. The convertible made its debut in October 2019 during a media event at the Kennedy Space Center to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. The racing version, the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R, also made its debut that same month.[8] Production officially began on February 3, 2020, delayed by the 2019 General Motors strike.[1]Overview[edit]Following several experimental CERV prototype vehicles, the C8 is GM\'s first production rear mid-engine sports car since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued. It features a vastly different design from previous Corvettes, with an all-new aluminum architecture and coil-over springs in place of leaf springs used on prior models. The exterior features more aggressive aerodynamics including larger air intakes and prominent side scoops. A trunk is located at the rear, with additional storage space at the front of the car. Combined, these provide 13 cubic feet (370 L) of cargo space, 2 cubic feet (57 L) less than that of the C7.[9] As a result of the switch to a mid-engine layout, the passenger cell has been shifted forward by 16.5 inches (420 mm).[10] The cockpit has been designed to be driver-centric, with numerous controls mounted on the center console as well as utilizing a new hexagonal steering wheel. A 12 in (30.5 cm) digital screen replaces the instrument cluster and reflects one of the six driving modes selected, and is accompanied by an 8 in (20.3 cm) touchscreen. A special Z button (a homage to Zora Arkus-Duntov ""Father of the Corvette"") is also mounted on the steering wheel; this can quickly activate customized performance settings.[11]-Corvette C8 Convertible-InteriorStingray[edit]Trim levels and options[edit]Three trim levels are currently available, 1LT, 2LT and 3LT, augmented by three suspension setups, FE1, FE3 and FE4 which correspond with the two Z51 Performance packages. In addition, three seat options are also available: GT1, GT2 and Competition Sport. The interior is upholstered in leather, microsuede or performance textile with carbon fiber or aluminum trims. A Performance Data Recorder has been upgraded with a higher resolution camera as well as a new interface. GM\'s virtual camera mirror is optional, which projects video from the backup camera onto the rear view mirror.[12][13]Engine[edit]The Stingray uses a new version of the LS-based GM small-block engine derived from the C7 Stingray\'s LT1, now called the LT2.[14] The new naturally aspirated 6.2 L V8 is rated at 490 hp (365 kW; 497 PS) at 6,450 rpm and 465 lb⋅ft (630 N⋅m) of torque at 5,150 rpm, an improvement of 40 hp (30 kW; 41 PS) and 10 lb⋅ft (14 N⋅m) over the outgoing C7 Corvette Stingray.[15] The engine uses dry sump lubrication system.[16] Like the C7, the C8 features Active Fuel Management, or cylinder deactivation, which is used when the car is subjected to low load scenarios such as highway cruising.[17][18]The engine has two radiators, one on each side in the front. The Z51 package includes a third radiator, a water-to-water and water-to-oil radiator on the rear driver\'s side, cooling both engine oil and transmission lubricant, taking air in through the rear quarter panel opening.[19]The optional NPP sport exhaust system brings the total power output to 495 hp (369 kW; 502 PS) and torque to 470 lb⋅ft (637 N⋅m).[20] Chevrolet claims that the C8 can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.9 seconds when equipped with the optional Z51 package;[12] Car and Driver recorded a time of 2.8 seconds (by subtracting a 1-foot rollout).[21]Transmission[edit]The Stingray is only offered with an 8-speed dual-clutch automated transmission[22] made by Tremec, with paddle shifters on the steering wheel.[23] No manual transmission option is available. The only other model years not offered with a manual transmission were the 1953–1954 C1 and the 1982 C3.[12][24]Suspension[edit]The base model of the Stingray comes with unequal length double wishbone suspension at the front and rear axles made from forged aluminum.[25] Monotube shock absorbers are standard at all four wheels. The car can be equipped with a front-axle lifting height adjustable suspension system that can add 2 in (40 mm) of ground clearance at speeds under 25 mph (40 km/h).[26]The Z51 package adds a performance-tuned adjustable suspension with higher front and rear spring rates and firmer dampers.[27] The front shocks, on vehicles without hydraulic front lift, and the rear shocks, have threaded spring seats that allow adjustment of the preload on the coil springs.[28] Additionally, the spring seat can be adjusted approximately 20 mm (0.8 in) up or down from the nominal position.[28]Magnetic Selective Ride Control is an available option for all trims and levels. On Z51 equipped Corvettes, Magnetic Selective Ride Control includes Performance Traction Management and electronic limited-slip differential (eLSD).[29]Wheels[edit]The Stingray is equipped with 19 in (48 cm) (front) and 20 in (51 cm) (rear) alloy wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport ALS tires, with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires available as a part of the Z51 performance package. All-season tires are used on base models for better grip.[30] The exact tire dimensions are 245/35ZR-19 at the front and 305/30ZR-20 at the rear.[12] The standard brakes are four-piston Brembo ventilated discs with diameters of 12.6 in (320 mm) at the front and 13.6 in (345 mm) at the rear. The Z51 package provides upgraded and enlarged brakes measuring 13.3 in (338 mm) at the front and 13.8 in (351 mm) at the rear.[25]Technology[edit]The C8 Corvette debuted with an 8-inch infotainment screen in a driver centric cockpit. It comes standard with Chevrolet\'s Infotainment 3 Plus system. Standard features include Bluetooth connectivity, 4G hotspot, and both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Higher trims are equipped with a 14-speaker Bose audio system and navigation options. Additional technology features include a performance data recorder package for 2LT and 3LT trim levels as well as a camera based rear view mirror.[31] The 2020 Corvette was the first year Chevrolet introduced over the air updates to the Corvette line-up. This allows Chevrolet to send updates to the vehicle remotely. Chevrolet used this capability to resolve a front trunk recall for the 2020 Corvettes.[32]Right-hand-drive (RHD)[edit]For the first time since the 1953 introduction of the Corvette (C1), the current generation Corvette is offered in right-hand-drive configuration for the Australian, New Zealand, Japanese, and UK markets.[33][34] The Corvette (C8) is General Motors\' only RHD vehicle to be assembled in the factory rather than converted from left-hand-drive. After the pre-sale announcement, 300 RHD Corvettes were sold within sixty hours: a record for the Corvette sales in Japan and three times the annual sales number for its left-hand-drive predecessor.[35] The introduction of RHD Corvette for Australian market was delayed to the middle of 2021 due to the reorganization of Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) into GMSV (General Motors Special Vehicles) which also brings GM vehicles into New Zealand. Only 200 RHD Corvettes will be sold in Australia per year, and the price is set at $149,990 AUD with higher performance versions above $200,000 AUD. The first sales of the RHD C8 in New Zealand were 28 cars in 2022.[36][37]Z06[edit]The performance version of the Corvette, the Z06, was unveiled on October 26, 2021. The Z06 entered production as a 2023 model year as a homologation vehicle.[38]Trim levels and options[edit]The Z06 has three trim levels adding various interior comfort and technology upgrades: 1LZ, 2LZ, and 3LZ. Additionally, the Z07 Performance Package can be applied to any trim that adds improved brakes, carbon fiber aerodynamic elements, suspension tuning, and performance tires.[39]Engine[edit]The Z06 uses a new naturally aspirated 5.5 L V8 producing 670 hp (500 kW; 679 PS) at 8,400 rpm, 460 lb⋅ft (624 N⋅m) of torque at 6,300 rpm and has a redline of 8,600 rpm.[40][41] This engine, dubbed the LT6, features a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) and a flat-plane crank, and surpasses the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Black Series\' M159 engine to become the most powerful naturally aspirated production V8.[42] A modified version of this engine has powered the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R since 2019, and many features in the racing engine carry over to the road engine.[43] Other features of this new engine include a cast aluminum block, dual coil valve springs supporting titanium intake & sodium filled exhaust valves, forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium connecting rods, active split intake manifold with twin 87mm throttle bodies, four-into-two-into-one stainless steel exhaust headers, and a factory six-stage 10-quart dry sump oiling system with individual crank bay scavenging.[41] A feature the LT6 shares with other Chevrolet small blocks is the bore spacing of 4.4 inches.[41][43]Transmission[edit]The Z06 uses the same 8-speed dual-clutch transmission used by Stingray models, albeit with a shorter 5.56:1 final drive ratio for improved acceleration. Chevrolet claims this allows the Z06 to accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 2.6 seconds.[44]Suspension[edit]The Z06 features the same basic suspension setup as the Stingray, however the electronic limited-slip differential and magnetic ride adaptive suspension system are now standard for all Z06 trims. The Z07 Performance Package includes the FE7 track-oriented suspension setup.[39]Wheels[edit]The Z06\'s body has been widened to accommodate larger wheels and thicker tires. The wheels have diameters of 20 inches (51 cm) at the front and 21 inches (53 cm) at the rear, and are available with standard alloy or optional carbon fiber rims. The tires have dimensions of 275/30ZR20 at the front and 345/25ZR21 at the rear, and the Z07 Performance Package comes standard with Michelin Cup 2 R ZP performance tires.[45] Chevrolet claims that the optional carbon fiber wheels, supplied by Australian manufacturer Carbon Revolution,[46] shave off 41 lb (19 kg) of unsprung weight.[47]Aerodynamics[edit]The base Z06 comes with a front splitter and a rear spoiler. Under the splitter are stall gurneys to reduce drag.[48] Included with the rear spoiler is an installable fixed Gurney flap, which when installed produces 365 lb (166 kg) pounds more downforce at 300 km/h (186 mph). The Z07 carbon fiber performance package adds a larger front-splitter, front corner canards (dive planes), a pedestal mounted rear wing, and underbody aero strakes, and removes the stall gurneys under the splitter for additional downforce.[41] Chevrolet claims that with all these equipped and in the track configuration, the Z06 is capable of 1.22g lateral acceleration on a skidpad.[41][49]Performance[edit]Chevrolet claims a 10.6-second quarter-mile time for the Z06 model when equipped with the Z07 package. The C8 Z06 is able to reach top speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour (320 km/h).[50]E-Ray[edit]The performance hybrid version of the Corvette, the E-Ray, was unveiled on January 17, 2023. The E-Ray will enter production as a 2024 model year and will be the quickest Corvette ever made as well as the first with all wheel drive and the first hybrid.[51]Trim levels and options[edit]The E-Ray has three trim levels adding various interior comfort and technology upgrades: 1LZ, 2LZ, and 3LZ. Additionally, there will be a ZER Performance Package that can be applied to any trim and It will include summer only tires as well as chassis tuning. The E-Ray will come standard with Carbon Ceramic brakes and an eAWD drivetrain.[52]Performance[edit]Chevrolet claims a 10.5-second quarter-mile time and a 0-60 time of 2.5 seconds making it the quickest Corvette to date in those categories.Modes[edit]Stealth Mode allows for all-electric driving at a maximum speed of 45 mph. Designed for quietly leaving the neighborhood. [53]Model year changes[edit]2020 model year[edit]The first production model of the C8 Corvette was the Stingray with a new mid-mounted 6.2 L LT2 V8 engine. It was available as a 2-door targa top or a retractable hardtop convertible. The targa top was available in body color, transparent, or visible carbon fiber.2021 model year[edit]Trim levels and options[edit]2021 saw a list of changes following the 2020 launch year of the C8 Corvette. Long Beach Red Metallic Tintcoat and Blade Silver Metallic were retired. Red Mist Metallic Tintcoat and Silver Flare Metallic were added as premium color options. Additionally, full length racing stripes saw 4 new color options.[54]The interior saw the addition of Sky Cool Gray / Strike Yellow color available only on the 3LT.[55] Magnetic Ride became available separate to the Z51 package for the 2021 model year. The Z51 package saw a price increase from $5,000 to $5,995 starting 2021. The front lift saw an increase from $1,495 to $1,995 as well.[56]Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto became standard options in 2021. Black Trident Spoke wheels, all weather floor liners, and carbon fiber mirror covers all saw minor price increases as well.[57]The 2021 C8 received a base price increase, mid way through the production cycle. Chevrolet raised the base price by $1000, putting it over the $60,000 threshold. The price increase was effective for all orders entered after March 1, 2021. The increase was attributed to a fluctuation in supplier parts costs as well as the global chip shortage which has delayed production in the automotive sector as a whole.[58]The end of the 2021 production year also saw the end of Sebring Orange, Shadow Gray, and Zeus Bronze as exterior color options.[59]Production[edit]The 2021 Corvette started production on December 8, 2020, due to extended production of the 2020 model year.[60] The 2021 model year saw production issues due to parts constraints.[61] Chevrolet also increased the base price of the Corvette by $1,000 in the middle of the 2021 model year, to $60,995.[62]2022 model year[edit]The LT2 saw fuel management system upgrades for the 2022 model year which featured a new fuel pump and injectors. The base price was also increased $1200 to compensate for increased supplier costs. A new IMSA GTLM Championship Edition package, limited to 1000 units, was introduced for 2022.[63]The 2022 model year saw the introduction of Caffeine Metallic, Amplify Orange Tintcoat, and Hypersonic Gray as new color options.[64]2023 model year[edit]GM and Chevrolet started production of the 2023 model year in the spring of 2022. 2023 saw multiple price increases early into the production year. In March, it was announced that the 2023 model year would see a $1000 base price increase. In May, the destination charge saw a minor $100 increase. During the start of production and launch of the 2023 configurator, GM raised the base price of the 2023 Corvette by $2300 making the new base price $65,595.[65][66] Several packages and options saw increases and adjustment to pricing.2023 also received a special edition variation of the Corvette to commemorate its 70th anniversary since the launch of the Corvette model. The 2023 Corvette Stingray 70th Anniversary Edition is a $5995 package atop the 3LT trim level. The special edition was offered in two exclusive colors of White Pearl Metallic Tri-Coat and Carbon Flash Metallic. Additionally, the package came with special wheels, badging, and VIN sequence to commemorate the vehicle\'s 70th year in the US market.[67]In addition to changes to the base Corvette, the Corvette Z06 was introduced with a 5.5 L LT6 V8 engine.[40]2024 model year[edit]The 2024 Corvette started production in the summer of 2023. The base price of the standard C8 went up from $64,500 to $66,300 (an increase of $1800), whereas the price of the C8 Z06 went up from $105,300 to $108,100 (an increase of $2800) No limited edition packages have been added, however some additional options have. For example, more carbon fiber elements (such as a carb fiber high wing and door mirror caps) have been added to the 2LT trim, a new carbon fiber spoiler styled after the Z06 high wing is now available for the base C8, and carbon fiber wheels with a red trim are now available as a top end option for the Z06.As of Summer 2023, the brand new hybrid Corvette C8 E-ray is now available, starting at $102,900.Production[edit]|Model Year|Stingray|Total|Coupe|Conv.|2020[68]|16,787|3,581|20,368|2021[69]|15,112|11,104|26,216|2022[70]|13,451|12,380|25,831Awards[edit]The Corvette C8 was named 2020 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[71] and was also featured on 2020 Car and Driver 10Best.[72] The C8 was also named 2020 North American Car of the Year,[73] 2020 Detroit Free Press Car of the Year,[74] and 2020 MotorWeek Drivers\' Choice Best of the Year.[75]References[edit]- ^ a b ""C8 Corvette Production Now Officially Underway"".

It is the first rear mid-engine Corvette since the model\'s introduction in 1953, differing from the traditional front mid-engine design started in 1963. The C8 was announced in April 2019, and the coupe made its official debut on July 18, 2019, in Tustin, California. The convertible made its debut in October 2019 during a media event at the Kennedy Space Center to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. The racing version, the Chevrolet Corvette C8.R, also made its debut that same month. Production officially began on February 3, 2020, delayed by the 2019 General Motors strike.\n\nFollowing several experimental CERV prototype vehicles, the C8 is GM\'s first production rear mid-engine sports car since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued. It features a vastly different design from previous Corvettes, with an all-new aluminum architecture and coil-over springs in place of leaf springs used on prior models. The exterior features more aggressive aerodynamics including larger air intakes and prominent side scoops. A trunk is located at the rear, with additional storage space at the front of the car. Combined, these provide 13 cubic feet (370 L) of cargo space, 2 cubic feet (57 L) less than that of the C7. As a result of the switch to a mid-engine layout, the passenger cell has been shifted forward by 16.5 inches (420 mm). The cockpit has been designed to be driver-centric, with numerous controls mounted on the center console as well as utilizing a new hexagonal steering wheel. A 12 in (30.5 cm) digital screen replaces the instrument cluster and reflects one of the six driving modes selected, and is accompanied by an 8 in (20.3 cm) touchscreen. A special Z button (a homage to Zora Arkus-Duntov ""Father of the Corvette"") is also mounted on the steering wheel; this can quickly activate customized performance settings.\n\nTrim levels and options\nThree trim levels are currently available, 1LT, 2LT and 3LT, augmented by three suspension setups, FE1, FE3 and FE4 which correspond with the two Z51 Performance packages. In addition, three seat options are also available: GT1, GT2 and Competition Sport. The interior is upholstered in leather, microsuede or performance textile with carbon fiber or aluminum trims. A Performance Data Recorder has been upgraded with a higher resolution camera as well as a new interface. GM\'s virtual camera mirror is optional, which projects video from the backup camera onto the rear view mirror.\n\nEngine\nThe Stingray uses a new version of the LS-based GM small-block engine derived from the C7 Stingray\'s LT1, now called the LT2. The new naturally aspirated 6.2 L V8 is rated at 490 hp (365 kW; 497 PS) at 6,450 rpm and 465 lb⋅ft (630 N⋅m) of torque at 5,150 rpm, an improvement of 40 hp (30 kW; 41 PS) and 10 lb⋅ft (14 N⋅m) over the outgoing C7 Corvette Stingray. The engine uses dry sump lubrication system. Like the C7, the C8 features Active Fuel Management, or cylinder deactivation, which is used when the car is subjected to low load scenarios such as highway cruising.\n\nThe engine has two radiators, one on each side in the front. The Z51 package includes a third radiator, a water-to-water and water-to-oil radiator on the rear driver\'s side, cooling both engine oil and transmission lubricant, taking air in through the rear quarter panel opening.\n\nThe optional NPP sport exhaust system brings the total power output to 495 hp (369 kW; 502 PS) and torque to 470 lb⋅ft (637 N⋅m). Chevrolet claims that the C8 can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.9 seconds when equipped with the optional Z51 package; Car and Driver recorded a time of 2.8 seconds (by subtracting a 1-foot rollout).\n\nTransmission\nThe Stingray is only offered with an 8-speed dual-clutch automated transmission made by Tremec, with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. No manual transmission option is available. The only other model years not offered with a manual transmission were the 1953–1954 C1 and the 1982 C3.\n\nSuspension\nThe base model of the Stingray comes with unequal length double wishbone suspension at the front and rear axles made from forged aluminum. Monotube shock absorbers are standard at all four wheels. The car can be equipped with a front-axle lifting height adjustable suspension system that can add 2 in (40 mm) of ground clearance at speeds under 25 mph (40 km/h).\n\nThe Z51 package adds a performance-tuned adjustable suspension with higher front and rear spring rates and firmer dampers. The front shocks, on vehicles without hydraulic front lift, and the rear shocks, have threaded spring seats that allow adjustment of the preload on the coil springs. Additionally, the spring seat can be adjusted approximately 20 mm (0.8 in) up or down from the nominal position.\n\nMagnetic Selective Ride Control is an available option for all trims and levels. On Z51 equipped Corvettes, Magnetic Selective Ride Control includes Performance Traction Management and electronic limited-slip differential (eLSD).\n\nWheels\nThe Stingray is equipped with 19 in (48 cm) (front) and 20 in (51 cm) (rear) alloy wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport ALS tires, with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires available as a part of the Z51 performance package. All-season tires are used on base models for better grip. The exact tire dimensions are 245/35ZR-19 at the front and 305/30ZR-20 at the rear. The standard brakes are four-piston Brembo ventilated discs with diameters of 12.6 in (320 mm) at the front and 13.6 in (345 mm) at the rear. The Z51 package provides upgraded and enlarged brakes measuring 13.3 in (338 mm) at the front and 13.8 in (351 mm) at the rear.\n\nTechnology\nThe C8 Corvette debuted with an 8-inch infotainment screen in a driver centric cockpit. It comes standard with Chevrolet\'s Infotainment 3 Plus system. Standard features include Bluetooth connectivity, 4G hotspot, and both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Higher trims are equipped with a 14-speaker Bose audio system and navigation options. Additional technology features include a performance data recorder package for 2LT and 3LT trim levels as well as a camera based rear view mirror. The 2020 Corvette was the first year Chevrolet introduced over the air updates to the Corvette line-up. This allows Chevrolet to send updates to the vehicle remotely. Chevrolet used this capability to resolve a front trunk recall for the 2020 Corvettes.\n\nRight-hand-drive (RHD)\nFor the first time since the 1953 introduction of the Corvette (C1), the current generation Corvette is offered in right-hand-drive configuration.'}]","""Corvette weight"" primarily refers to the curb weight of various Chevrolet Corvette models, a crucial specification that significantly impacts the vehicle's performance, handling dynamics, and fuel efficiency. This measurement, representing the car's mass without occupants or cargo but with standard equipment and full fluids, is a key focus in the design and engineering of America's iconic sports car.

Optimizing weight is a perpetual goal for high-performance vehicle manufacturers. As Tadge Juechter, Corvette Executive Chief Engineer, emphasizes, ""Weight is the enemy of performance, and every pound saved contributes to a more agile and responsive driving experience."" This philosophy underpins the engineering decisions aimed at balancing power with agility and maintaining the Corvette's competitive edge.

For instance, the 2024 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Coupe boasts a curb weight of approximately 3,647 pounds (1,654 kg), a figure meticulously managed to deliver its renowned acceleration and cornering capabilities. This strategic weight management is critical for achieving the Corvette's performance benchmarks.

Should celebrities have a greater responsibility to use their influence for social causes?,"['intermediate', 'debate', 'people and society', 'non-technical', 'question', 'opinion', 'research', 'sensitive', 'informational']","[{'raw_text': '[Opinion] Celebrities must use their power to address issues that impact societyOctober 25, 2020In the age where social justice issues dominate global media, it is becoming increasingly difficult to evade matters of contention, especially for celebrities. From Black Lives Matter to the #MeToo movement, a wide variety of celebrities have utilized their public platform to propagate a meaningful message.These prominent figures undoubtedly have a strong influence on the general public’s opinion, and their voices heavily impact younger generations. While some celebrities remain apprehensive about sharing their opinions in fear of backlash, many are beginning to realize that by expressing their beliefs and advocating for change, they could potentially change society for the better.For example in 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem in protest of the atrocities America has committed against the Black community, an event that served as the catalyst for the current conversation around celebrity influence. As a result of this silent protest, American citizens began to reevaluate the treatment of Black Americans in this country with many being inspired to follow in his footsteps.In 2020, athletes and activists alike continue to carry Kaepernick’s message despite his original protest taking place four years ago. According to a 2019 poll conducted by Cambridge University, Kaepernick is responsible for inspiring nearly one-third of Black Americans to donate to a political cause, protest or boycott the NFL. In the same study, it was made apparent that Kaepernick influenced more than half of Black Americans to vote in a local or national election.These statistics make it abundantly clear that celebrities have a power like no other. If one man can influence a large portion of a community, imagine if every celebrity voiced their opinions on social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram.However, Kaepernick is not the only celebrity using their influence for good. Socialite and businesswoman Kim Kardashian West has been advocating for prison reform over the past two years.During this time, Kardashian West, with the help of others, successfully lobbied President Donald Trump to pass the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that attempts to reduce the probability of inmates repeating an offense through sentence reduction and other tactics. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the First Step Act has reduced the sentence of roughly 1,700 people convicted of cocaine offenses.Kardashian West’s persistence and success is a testament to the notion that celebrities are incredibly influential. Regardless of how the public views her, she was able to achieve one of her goals for prison reform and sway a major political figure into promoting change within our criminal justice system.While many believe that celebrities have no business in politics, given our nation’s current social climate, it is a near impossibility for these figures to separate themselves from the political landscape surrounding them. Regardless of your status or political affiliation, these issues must be addressed and when celebrities acknowledge the world around them, it initiates conversation.As anti-apartheid leader Desmond Tutu once said, “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”The power of a celebrity holds a unique weight in modern society, and celebrities ought to use this power to advocate for social causes that are affecting the world around them.These individuals arguably have the same amount of, if not more, influence over the general public than politicians. Therefore, why should they remain silent on such important issues?This country must change, and celebrities have the power to help it do so.

By the second.Earlier this month, Pepsi released a new soda commercial that placed fashion model Kendall Jenner at the forefront of a large protest for an unknown, yet seemingly passionate and powerful cause. In the commercial, Jenner joins the protest (reminiscent to the anti war protests in the 60s) and ends the protest not through awareness of the serious issue in question, but by handing a heavily armed police officer a can of Pepsi. The crowd cheers, and it cuts to the ads main tag line “Live bolder, live louder.”At first glance, the ad seems harmless. It is lighthearted, and aims to present an idealized version of our world that promotes peace, sharing and love. However, at second glance, people began to be outraged by the message the ad relayed: that the only weapon the people have left in their artillery to fight back was being dismantled by the perverse lightheartedness of this advertisement, during a very dark, tumultuous time in our history.In the commercial, it seemed as if Pepsi, or rather the world, was purposely being ignorant of the hardships that people who attend these kind of protests have to face every day. It seemed as if it was okay to appropriate important causes such as the Black Lives Matter protests, for the sake of selling a beverage.The commercial seemed disturbingly ignorant of the struggles of minorities and people who feel don’t like they have a voice in this country. It undercuts the efforts of those fighting through blood, sweat and tears over causes they believe in.Imagine Martin Luther King Jr. or Malcolm X winning the civil rights movement by merely providing police officials with a carbonated beverage. If only life were that simple.Although Pepsi is getting a lot of flack for the entire debacle, the recipient of most of the outrage and anger towards the ad is directed toward Jenner, who merely modeled in the ad. She mainly serves a figurehead for the commercial through her fame and influence rather than being creatively tied to the project itself.Though this is true, the anger directed towards Jenner lies, not in her creative contribution to the ad, but to the power of her influence she inflicts upon her fans by participating in it.Whether celebrities know it or not, their actions insight reactions upon other individuals. The question lies whether they are morally or even civically obligated to understand the social repercussion of their actions.Some argue that it is not their responsibility and they are not in the position they are in to have social consciousness, accompanied in choices they make or the actions in which they pursue. However, even if this were true, there is no avoiding the undeniable truth that their clout within society unceremoniously holds weight amongst the public.It invokes reaction not only among the impressionable, but among those that are worried about impressing.The problem with this commercial then becomes two fold through the offense of its lightheartedness, but also at its long term repercussions by celebrity influence. In Jenner’s case, this means that people may ignorantly assume that there are no real problems in America, that Black Lives Matter is not a huge issue and everything is perfect and great when it comes to social issues.Through ignoring these social responsibilities, celebrities can unknowingly unravel and destabilize what those fighting for civil and social justice have long tried to embed into the minds of the ignorant: that humans are humans are humans and that we all are equal.To undercut these efforts by unwittingly influencing their fans otherwise, (whether or not it was on purpose), does the world and humanity a massive disservice.Whether it is desired by celebrities or not, people follow what they choose to say or do, leaving them with a social responsibility to try to improve the world we live in, or at the very least, not add fuel to the flames.

Even amid the tumult at X, formerly known as Twitter, there are still tons of celebrities on the platform, not to mention on Instagram, who have tens of millions of followers, some even have more than 100 million followers. #MeToo first surfaced in 2006 at the keyboard of activist Taran Burke, but with one tweet from Alyssa Milano in 2017, a worldwide movement was launched. Simply being famous provides a wider platform for celebrities to get a message across. When Michelle Obama took to social media in 2016 to raise awareness for kidnapped Nigerian girls, the world paid attention. In 2018, after Taylor Swift broke her long-held silence on politics, voter registration spiked by 65,000 new registered voters in the first 24 hours. And, in recent years, once Kim Kardashian took up the cause for prison reform, she was able to make significant political impact on the issue.Using Old Tactics to Change The WorldWhen a celebrity gives their endorsement to a product, they generate brand recognition and provide a sense of familiarity and trust, which equals sales. So, if celebrity endorsement can push product sales, why not use the same model to boost social responsibility? The UN has been using Goodwill Ambassadors as representatives for decades. Becoming a UN Goodwill Ambassador means going through a vetting system that requires having a sizeable number of followers as well as producing the right kind of image. To represent a charity means living your life in accordance with their message, which many celebrities embrace and embody willingly. In these cases, celebrity activists can do a world of good.Celebrities Are People TooIn terms of mental illness, abuse and poverty, no one is immune, not even celebrities or royalty. Members of the British royal family (especially estranged members) have openly discussed depression and therapy, peeling back the stigma surrounding mental health and celebrity, showing the world that everyone is susceptible. Comedian Jim Carrey speaks frankly about being homeless as a young teen. Actress Tiffany Haddish openly discusses growing up in foster care. Actor-turned-podcaster Dax Shephard talks about being molested as a child and subsequent drug addiction. Everyone has a story, yet some of us are given a larger stage than others on which to express it. Celebrity activists should be commended for embracing such a stage.All That Shimmers Is Not Gold (The Cons)Where Have All the Experts Gone?By giving our time and educating ourselves through celebrity activism, we discount experts who have given unwavering dedication to the cause. Sixty-six percent of people surveyed in a poll could not link a celebrity with their sponsored charity. This suggests that celebrity is not enough to sell an idea; yet you’re more likely to hear about climate change from celebrities or social activists turned celebrities (think Greta Thunberg) than professional environmentalists or actual climate scientists. In many cases, the celebrity name will stick while the cause won’t, leaving actual experts desperate for an audience. Plus, in today’s golden age of podcasts, almost anyone can have an audio platform from which to spout “advice” and different degrees of “truth.” This has sidelined the real experts. For instance, professional health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci faced challenges to get their messages out to the public when podcasters like Joe Rogen were espousing unsubstantiated claims and misinformation about Covid and Covid vaccines.When Your Audience is Focused on Image Over EducationSupporting celebrity activists contributes to the culture of failure and promotes what is called “Slacktivism.” This relatively new term describes people who consider themselves online activists but are actually more concerned with appearing to join the right cause but, in actuality, doing as little as possible to make a difference. When activism is a trend, misinformation runs rampant. The culture of failure puts so much pressure on succeeding that we forget how to sit back and educate ourselves, and to take the time to decide what we believe in and, more importantly, how to act on these beliefs. And it’s not just the audience’s focus. Sometimes celebrities need a reminder that image isn’t everything and that efforts or messages to try to inspire activism in others can backfire.

However, in the world of celebrity, staying relevant is a constant battle. This means that celebrities often need to reinvent themselves, which can affect the cause(s) they are supporting. When New York City made Taylor Swift its Global Welcome Ambassador in 2014, officials were counting on her “wholesome” image, as promoted in her strategically timed release of her single “Welcome to New York.” However, by the time her next album dropped, her previously wholesome image had dramatically changed.

Through the click of one button, they can access thousands of loyal fans who value their treasured celebrity’s opinion. While this comes with tremendous responsibility, it can effectively get important messages across to society.According to an article from SAGE Journals, celebrities have the ability to “...bring about changes in attitudes and beliefs in the audience” (Lindberg, Jolly, & Stapel 1). As people look up to their favorite athletes or singers, they are likely to listen when they have something to say. Given this privilege, these people must use their platforms to affect positive social change.Naomi Osaka, arguably one of the current best female tennis players, is a perfect example of this. With almost 3 million followers on Instagram and over a million followers on Twitter, Osaka has the opportunity to reach and impact millions of people. Additionally, her status as an athlete opens more doors for her to appear on national and international news sites viewed by many.After withdrawing from the French Open, Osaka opened up about her struggles with anxiety and depression. In a USA Today article, she expressed that preserving her mental health and practicing self-care was more important than her tennis career (Gleeson 1). Though she was met with tremendous backlash from the tennis community, “Osaka said she heard from a plethora of people who struggle with their mental health who felt inspired by her” (Gleeson 1).Seeing an accomplished and seemingly happy woman be vulnerable about her mental health can help give others the courage to do the same. Though Osaka recognizes that she does not have all the answers to mental health, merely sharing her struggles can help others feel less alone.Like Osaka, iconic musician Beyonce provides another example of a celebrity who uses her platform to spread important messages. Amassing over 30 million listeners on Spotify and a considerable fanbase, Beyonce uses her music to address issues such as racism and sexism.For example, in her 2014 performance at the MTV VMAs, “...she launched into a rendition of the female anthem ‘Flawless,’ with lines from poet Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s essay “We Should All Be Feminists” plastered on the screen” (Penrose 1).Additionally, in YouTube’s global virtual graduation ceremony, Dear Class of 2020, she encouraged graduates to continue supporting the Black Lives Matter Movement and the broader fight against racism in our society (BBC 1).Like Beyonce and Osaka, other celebrities should use their voices to lift people up and ultimately make the world a better place. They must recognize the weight of their words and the tremendous privilege they have in being a celebrity. Unfortunately, not everyone has access to these opportunities or platforms, so it is vital that they take advantage of them.As mentioned in the introduction, everyone can affect social change. Many brilliant activists are not afforded the same platforms as celebrities, yet they are still able to move mountains. That being said, the task of social justice should not be given to celebrities alone, but, it is important to acknowledge the pivotal role that celebrities such as Osaka and Beyonce can play.Sources:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0190272511398208https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2021/07/08/naomi-osaka-opens-up-french open-withdrawal-mental-health/7899251002/https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/beyonce-activist-8061796/ https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52962717', 'url': 'https://www.thewomens.network/blog/celebrities-must-use-their-platforms-to-affect-social-change', 'cleaned_text': 'Though every person has the ability to affect social change, celebrities have the unique privilege of reaching a vast audience.

Amassing over 30 million listeners on Spotify and a considerable fanbase, Beyonce uses her music to address issues such as racism and sexism.\n\nFor example, in her 2014 performance at the MTV VMAs, “...she launched into a rendition of the female anthem ‘Flawless,’ with lines from poet Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s essay “We Should All Be Feminists” plastered on the screen” (Penrose 1).\nAdditionally, in YouTube’s global virtual graduation ceremony, Dear Class of 2020, she encouraged graduates to continue supporting the Black Lives Matter Movement and the broader fight against racism in our society (BBC 1).\nLike Beyonce and Osaka, other celebrities should use their voices to lift people up and ultimately make the world a better place. They must recognize the weight of their words and the tremendous privilege they have in being a celebrity. Unfortunately, not everyone has access to these opportunities or platforms, so it is vital that they take advantage of them.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, everyone can affect social change. Many brilliant activists are not afforded the same platforms as celebrities, yet they are still able to move mountains. That being said, the task of social justice should not be given to celebrities alone, but, it is important to acknowledge the pivotal role that celebrities such as Osaka and Beyonce can play.\n\nSources:\n- [SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0190272511398208)\n- [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2021/07/08/naomi-osaka-opens-up-french-open-withdrawal-mental-health/7899251002/)\n- [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/beyonce-activist-8061796/)\n- [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52962717)'}, {'raw_text': 'ORIGINAL RESEARCH articleSec.

Their influence is reflected in public recognition. This research classifies celebrity social responsibility as behavior within the law, professionalism, family ethics, public morality, and charity. We selected 286 cinematic celebrities as study objects and obtained public recognition data through 2,600 questionnaire surveys. The findings of the study indicate that there is a positive, linear relationship between cinematic celebrities’ social responsibility and public recognition. In particular, family ethics and public moral responsibility demonstrate a significant positive correlation with public recognition. However, there was no significant correlation found between lawful responsibility and public recognition. Finally, this paper makes additional suggestions and recommendations drawn from the data and reported in the conclusion.IntroductionIn China, particularly in recent years, cinematic celebrities have engaged in a variety of misconduct that includes, but is not limited to, endorsement of false advertising, organized criminal behavior, marital infidelity, drunk driving, fighting, and drug abuse (Ren, 2014; Zhang, 2020). The frequency of celebrity endorsement in China ranks third in the world. Some advertisements endorsed by movie stars manifest abnormal behavior, such as product distortion, false promises, and value-oriented deviation, which harm the interests of consumers and destroy the moral value of society (Liu, 2020). Based on the positive behavior evaluation indexes, movie stars’ responsibility performance scores are very low in China (Zhang and Xue, 2021). With the exposure of large-scale tax evasion (made public in June 2018) and adverse legal judgments amounting to thousands of millions Yuan in administrative punishments, cinematic celebrity social responsibility behaviors have become the focus of social attention and concern.The subject of cinematic celebrities is very hot in marketing. Therefore, an extensive body of literature shows that celebrity endorsements lead to higher levels of consumer–brand patronage intentions. Sports apparel brands choose athletes as celebrity endorsers to enhance positive attitudes and encourage merchandise sales (Intravia et al., 2020). In sports literature, studies show that consumers are more likely to display higher levels of purchase intention when they associate themselves with endorsed athletes (Eyada, 2020). Specifically, researchers found that companies could achieve a variety of benefits from athlete endorsements, such as a consumer’s increased probability of brand choice, intention to pay a premium price, and positive word of mouth (Carrillat et al., 2019). This research investigate that how the celebrities’ reputation can be used for better social responsibilities.As public figures, movie stars expect public recognition and so they try to present their “good moral behaviors” (their good said, as it were) in public (Guo, 2015). The audiences’ recognition of stars comes from their screen images and life images. From a societal perspective, movie stars can provide followers with value guidance, so that they should themselves be encouraged to consider their behavior in connection with their social responsibility (Wang and Yan, 2019; Stojanovic et al., 2020). However, due to some audiences’ (especially teenagers’) irrational pursuit of stars, stars demonstrating poor moral behavior may also be recognized by the public, while, conversely, stars showing good moral behavior may not attract enough recognition (Qin and Chen, 2021).This research has two main objectives. First, it investigates the correlation between a celebrity’s social responsibility performance and public recognition. Secondly, it asks what kind of responsibility exerts significant influence on that public recognition. In order to investigate these two objectives, we selected 286 cinematic celebrities as study objects and derived their responsibilities’ scores by using an evaluation index system. Additionally, we obtained public recognition data through 2,600 questionnaire surveys and studied the relationship between cinematic celebrities’ responsibilities and public recognition. This research focuses on how to evaluate individual responsibility and the relationship between celebrities’ social responsibility performance and public recognition, and accordingly it offers suggestions to guide and encourage movie stars to be more responsible toward their society that are presented in the conclusion of the paper.Literature reviewStudies on the “star system”In developed countries, research conducted on cinematic celebrities generally focuses on the “star system” and it is yet to demonstrate a clear interest in celebrity social responsibility consciousness and behavior relative to their communities and to society at large. Instead, research emphasis is concentrated on systemic production of star imagery.The “star system” originated with the American film industry (Dyer, 1979). It was, and remains, a mechanism of propaganda and promotion for commercial operations to construct a specific symbolic image (personality, identity, and appearance) of a celebrity to be disseminated to the general public. The “star system” was described as an operation mode by Thomas Harris. Under that mode, celebrities are subservient to an interest group (Harris, 1991). Charles Eckert’s “Jump Cut” in 1974 refers to the philanthropic-star image created purposefully during the Depression to mobilize the wealthy classes to bear the financial burdens of that era (Eckert, 1974). This mature “star system” mechanism has built the star image that has, to a very considerable extent, been accepted by the public, and it maintained as the star’s public image. Under this mechanism, the star is created by complicated production procedures. The star is subject to economic power and autocracy, by which their public image is manipulated and consolidated.Therefore, in western countries, under the “star system’s” mature operation mode, the individual star is subject to the design and arrangement of the overall system, an amalgamation of the economic needs of the film industry and the acceptance of the general public. The social responsibility of movie stars themselves does not appear as a prominent social problem, and there is little related research on that.Research on celebrity social responsibilityThere are many studies about social responsibility, but these tend to concentrate on the social responsibility of enterprises, not of individuals (Zhong, 2018; Shimul et al., 2020). Some related research has noted celebrity misconduct, such as advertising endorsements, drug abuse, and divorce, but few studies have defined the concept of (individual) celebrity social responsibility. Researchers have begun to distinguish corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate social advocacy (CSA). Because CSA can often promote challenging beliefs and objectives, it is frequently distinguished from CSR, which entails charitable support for broadly popular projects. Because the nature of the corporate support is different, CSR and CSA efforts generate distinctive consumer responses. While CSA often results in polarized reactions, CSR messages usually evoke support or general ambivalence from customers (Rim et al., 2020).Celebrity social obligations include economic, political, cultural, and moral responsibility (Lin, 2002; Hao and Zhang, 2009). In addition, stars are expected to fulfill their philanthropic responsibility, especially with charitable contributions to promote the moral growth of youth and improve the level of civilized behavior both in local communities and the whole society. The premise of fulfilling responsibilities by stars is that they have a moral responsibility and should play a role in demonstration of moral behavior to the public (Yu, 2007). In this way, celebrity fulfillment of social responsibility is an ethical requirement. Accepting that responsibility meets stated ethical requirements, whereas shirking or refusing to do so is contrary to those requirements (Li, 2011).Negative celebrity behaviors can be divided into two major categories: illegal behaviors and immoral behaviors (Zhang and Zhao, 2016). There are many studies focusing on advertising endorsement from a legal standpoint. A star who has provided a false endorsement must bear a corresponding legal liability (Yao and Duan, 2009; Wu, 2010). At the very least, stars who endorse products must bear prudential and self-certification obligations (Liu N. L., 2015).Also from a legal standpoint, research on drug abuse incidents involving public figures indicates that social responsibility includes two levels. The first is the level of aggregation, which is the lawful requirement of individual stars. The second is the level of discrete meaning, referring directly to mandatory obligation (Liu and Wu, 2015). In China, large-scale tax evasion by celebrities have been demarcated as breaking the “bottom line” of the law, which means that celebrities, collectively, may be seen as lacking in their sense of legal responsibility and are thereby acting against basic social justice (Zhong, 2018). Liu explains this phenomenon as a consequence attributed to factors such as disorder in the moral value system and the decline of an individual’s conscious morality, particularly during periods of social transition (Liu Y., 2015). In regard to the definition and classification of celebrity social responsibilities, the literature primarily addresses ethical and legal issues, and has not formed a complete system index to address social responsibility. Therefore, this study has defined the concept of celebrity responsibility, and then works on creating a cinematic celebrities’ social responsibility evaluation system, which is key to achieving our research objectives.The relationship between social responsibility and public recognition of cinematic celebritiesHistorically psychoanalytic theory indicates that recognition is the key mechanism for identity generation (Freud, 1921; Shimul et al., 2020). The study of the “star system” suggests that difference between stars and the public brings glamor and a “thrill” which produces that recognition. In this process of cultural consumption, it is easy to produce uncritical recognition (Stacey, 1991). There is close link between social acceptance and compliance with community rules, which is reflected in the data. The acquired ability of social acceptance for celebrities is dependent on their compliance with group rules. When an individual’s actions are consistent with community rules, the celebrity is able to acquire social recognition (Zhong and Li, 2016). When an individual’s behavior violates those group rules, they will be criticized by society (Ruan et al., 2005), and a celebrity’s misdemeanors then come to have a negative influence on the public’s liking of that celebrity.Many academic studies focus on celebrity endorsement as one dimension of their responsibilities, and they have confirmed that there is a correlation between it and consumer recognition of the products the celebrities endorse. Compared with lack of such an endorsement, celebrity and online star endorsement have positive effects on consumers’ purchase intentions (Shi et al., 2021). However, negative celebrity publicity influences consumer attitudes and moral reputation plays an important role in that (Zhou and Whitla, 2013). The relationship between the celebrity and the consumer can also be negatively affected by a celebrity’s misbehavior (Banister and Cocker, 2014). Existing research analysis pay more attention to the relationship between the celebrity and the consumer from the market perspective (Pradhan et al., 2016; Sääksjärvi et al., 2016; Branchik and Chowdhury, 2017), but consumers are just part of the public who consume the image and activities of the celebrity (Littler, 2011) and they cannot as a group represent all the public who know and follow a particular celebrity (or celebrities).In summary, there are few clearly delineated studies on the relationship between celebrity social responsibility and public recognition. To address this research gap, this study selects 286 movie stars as its research object, evaluates their social responsibility performances quantitatively, investigates public recognition, and explores the relationship between their social responsibility and their public recognition. It contributes to making clear the relationship between their social responsibility and public recognition as being an important and influential part of society.Research methodologyConcept definition and hypothesisBased on the above literature review, and considering the purposes of this paper, we define the social responsibility of cinematic celebrities as a requirement of society for that specific group, and one that is reflected in the expectations of the public and society. On the basis of the classification of CSR (Classon and Dahlstrõm, 2006; Marakova et al., 2021), combining the characteristics of individuals, celebrities’ social responsibility is divided into five categories: legal responsibility, professional responsibility, family ethical responsibility, public moral responsibility, and charity responsibility.Public recognition refers to the degree of acceptance of a particular star from the public domain based on the understanding and judgment of the star’s social responsibility-related behaviors. As human beings, we exercise moral judgment: when we see an action or hear a story, we have an instant feeling of approval or disapproval (Greene and Haidt, 2002). The public can choose to approve or disapprove of particular celebrities according to their behaviors. A celebrity endorser enjoys public recognition and uses this recognition (McCracken, 1989), but morality is important for them to get and maintain that recognition. Celebrity endorsers’ credibility has positive impacts on consumer’s recognition of them and of the products they endorse (Pornpitakpan, 2008). Once a celebrity commits a transgression, consumer attitudes toward that celebrity become weaker (Shimul et al., 2020). Unethical behaviors exert a negative influence on both the celebrity and the brands they are endorsing (Thomas and Fowler, 2016). Therefore, the public always give more recognition to those celebrities who hold to their responsibilities. Based on the above discussion, we hypothesize:H: Social responsibility performance of cinematic celebrities has positive impacts on their public recognition: specifically in the case of legal liability, professional liability, family ethical responsibility, public responsibility, and charitable moral responsibility, each of these five performances have positive impacts on public recognition.Research designThe research design includes: constructing the cinematic celebrities’ social responsibility evaluation system and determining the weights of the first-level and the second-level indexes; collecting the social responsibility performance data of the sample through content analysis taken from various forms of text; conducting a questionnaire design and investigation on the degree of public recognition; obtaining public recognition scores; and studying the relationship between responsibility and recognition through statistical methods.In this paper, we applied the “Bass Law” to design the assessment scale. Bass “quantifies” the “level scale determined by the behaviors” (Bradburn et al., 2004). First, we developed an ideal behavioral scale by confirmation, definition and extraction of the star case samples. Second, we invited experts (e.g., from academia and journalism) to correct the work, and repeated this until most experts were in agreement with the scale. Finally, we generated and provided the scores of the behavior scale in accordance with the specific details, including degree, frequency, efficiency, scale, and other specified criteria.Create celebrity social responsibility evaluation index systemBased on various media reports and online disclosures, this paper utilizes extracted data from 400 cases indicating social responsibility performance, and summarizes the primary irresponsible behaviors of the stars. Combining the definition and classifications of cinematic celebrity social responsibility, the construction of the evaluation system was undertaken.Then, we randomly selected 30 movie stars for an evaluation test and consulted experts from the film industry, social responsibility research experts and entertainment reporters to review the system. According to the results of the evaluation test and the experts’ opinions, some indicators were added or adjusted. Indicators developed from this process include five first-level indicators, 25 second-level indicators, and 37 third-level indicators. In order to make the research results more objective, we use the “entropy” method to determine the weights of the indexes. Results are presented in Table 1.Quantitative evaluation of celebrity social responsibilityOf more than 7,000 film actors in China, we filtered and eliminated the lesser-known actors from that population in view of their lack of visibility to the public. The filtering resulted in a well-known population of 2,000 celebrities. We then applied a random sample method to those remaining 2,000 actors, resulting in a sample of 400 celebrities. Following the administration of the pilot survey, some stars were again filtered out of the sample in accordance with the survey results. Subsequently, 286 of the most popular film celebrities were selected for the final sample.Employing the content analysis method, celebrity social behavioral data were retrieved from media reports. Behaviors were chosen in accordance with specific celebrity conduct that has been listed as one of the three-level indicators of the corresponding evaluation system (see Table 1).The behavioral scores were generated relative to the results of the media and public report search. In this process, the entropy weight method was used. This particular method is more objective in providing index weights in comparison to other methods. It can be used to standardize the index value under the condition that the distribution of the index is not uniform and the quantity metric units are different across variables.In accordance with “Bass Law,” the scores are divided into two categories: the first is the degree of the behavior, where the values are “none = 4, slight = 3, average = 2, serious = 1, very serious = 0,” and the second category is the frequency of the behavior, where the values are “no = 2, occasionally = 1, frequent = 0.” Next in the process, and according to the specific characteristics of each behavior, the degree index and the frequency index are individually calculated to determine the values of the third-level indexes.Then we use the entropy weight method through MATLAB software to determine the weights. First, we standardized the third-level index scores. We denoted the third-level index scores as X1,X2,X3……Xk, and the “n-th” score of the “j-th” indexes were X1j, X2j, X3j……Xnj. We entered the data into the MATLAB and used the entropy method to calculate and report the normalized index value, called Y1,Y2,Y3……Yk, and (1≤i≤n). Second, we calculated each index’s comentropy. According to the definition of comentropy (using “Ej” to symbolize it), each index score’s comentropy; where , if pij = 0, then = 0. Last, we calculated the weight of the second index. According to each third-index score’s Ej value and the formula (i = 1,2,3……k),WI, the weights of the second-level index were calculated.We obtained the scores of the second-level index by their weights. The weights and scores of the first-level indexes were obtained by the same method, and finally the social responsibility score of each star was calculated.Questionnaire on public recognitionThe survey questionnaire method was adopted to determine public recognition of selected celebrities. This recognition questionnaire was distributed to all provinces in China except Tibet and Taiwan. Each respondent involved in the inquiry only needed to evaluate the recognition of 20 randomly selected actors from the final 286 most popular celebrities’ sample. The questionnaire design was based on a 7-point Likert-scale, where “Strongly recognize” = 7, “Recognize” = 6, “Somewhat recognize” = 5, “Neutral” = 4, “Do not recognize somewhat” = 3, “Do not recognize” = 2, and “Do not recognize strongly” = 1. The questionnaires that were filled out by each survey participant were randomly sampled to ensure the reliability of the survey results. After having eliminated invalid responses, the average scores were public recognition scores of cinematic celebrities in the sample.The survey was implemented using three diverse delivery methods: in-person, e-mail, and an online survey platform. A total of 2,600 questionnaires was distributed, yielding 2,248 qualifying, valid surveys. The questionnaire valid rate was 86.46% and the effective evaluation of each celebrity has been drawn more than 120 times. According to the method of determining the sample size for the statistical sampling survey, the result is reliable so long as each celebrity has been drawn upon 50 times or more. Therefore, the survey results meet the requirements of the investigative methodology. Among the final valid questionnaires, the age distribution is as follows: 18–35 years old accounted for 80.87%, 36–45 years old accounted for 13.92%, and respondents 46 years old and above accounted for 5.21%. The educational background distribution is as follows: junior college and below accounted for 10.85%, university undergraduate accounted for 78.43%, and those with master and doctorate degrees accounted for 10.72%. Occupational distribution is as follows: 966 students accounted for 42.97%, 356 government organs or institutions personnel accounted for 15.84%, 768 general enterprise personnel accounted for 34.16%, 64 entrepreneurs accounted for 2.85%, and the remaining 94 people accounted for 4.18%.ResultsDescriptive statistical analysisThe Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.807 and KMO value of 0.971 passed the reliability and validity test. In order to understand the overall characteristics of social responsibility and public recognition, a descriptive statistical analysis was initially conducted. The detailed results are shown in Table 2.Descriptive statistical analysis shows the lowest total score of social responsibility is 16.39, the highest score is 28.54, and the average score is 26.84 across 286 celebrities. For the five categories of responsibility, the average score of legal responsibility is the highest, followed by professional responsibility, and charity responsibility is the lowest. This shows that film celebrities generally have a strong sense of law and it is not common to violate the law; most of them abide by professional ethics, relative to their other responsibilities. However, in terms of charitable endeavors, celebrities are not generally active.Correlation analysisCorrelation analysis is designed to test whether or not there is correlation between variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient is commonly used. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 3. The table is presented in visual form in Figure 1.According to the analytical results, there is a statistically significant correlation between the overall performance of celebrity social responsibility and their public recognition scores. Specifically, legal performance is significantly and positively related to public recognition, such as in cases of drug abuse, traffic violations, false endorsements, and other responsibilities related to breaking the law. At the professional level, there is a statistically significant and positive correlation with recognition, such as professionalism and quality of work. There is also a significant positive correlation between the performance of celebrities within the family, such as derailment behavior, domestic violence and other types of family responsibility performance and public recognition. Finally, there is a significant positive correlation between the performance of public moral responsibility and recognition, as well as their performance in charity and motivation.Regression analysisBefore conducting the regression, we need to classify the scores for public recognition. Because public recognition score is based on a 7-point Likert Scale, the score of every celebrity is between 1 and 7. The classification criteria are: less than or equal to 1.5 = 1, greater than 1.5 and less than or equal to 2.5 = 2; greater than 2.5 and less than or equal to 3.5 = 3; greater than 3.5 and less than or equal to 4.5 = 4; greater than 4.5 and less than or equal to 5.5 = 5; greater than 5.5 and less than or equal to 6.5 = 6; more than 6.5 and less than or equal to 7 = s 7. Since the dependent variable is ordered classified data, while the independent variable is continuous data, the Ordinal Regression method is adopted.Regression analysis of the total score of social responsibility of cinematic celebrities and public recognitionThe results are shown in Tables 4–6. The parallel test result in Table 4 shows that the P-value is 0.618, which is greater than 0.05, indicating that the model accepts the null hypothesis, that is, the parallel test is satisfied, and further analysis can be performed. Table 5 shows the likelihood ratio test results, demonstrating the overall effectiveness of the model. The P-value is less than 0.001, illustrating the overall model is meaningful, because at least one variable coefficient does not equal 0.The summary of the model results is shown in Table 6. The pseudo-R-squared value of the model is 0.074, meaning that the total score of social responsibility can explain the reason for the change of 7.4% of public recognition. The regression coefficient value is 0.293, with a significance level of 0.01, which means that the total level of social responsibility has a significant positive impact on public recognition.Regression analysis of the performance of various dimensions of social responsibility of cinematic celebrities and public recognitionThe regression analysis method is the same as above. The results are shown in Tables 7–9. The parallel test results of the model in Table 7 show that the P-value is 0.494, which is greater than 0.05, indicating that the model accepts the null hypothesis, that is, the parallel test is satisfied, and further analysis can be performed. Table 8 illustrates the results of the model likelihood ratio test, and because P < 0.001 the model as a whole is meaningful.The summary of the parameter estimate results is shown in Table 9. The pseudo-R-squared value of the model is 0.121, meaning that legal liability, professional responsibility, family responsibility, public responsibility, and charity responsibility can explain the reason for the change in public acceptance of 12.1%. The regression coefficient of legal liability is −0.584, and the significance level is 0.05, indicating that legal responsibility has a significant negative impact on public recognition. In contrast, the correlation coefficients for family responsibilities and public responsibilities are 0.562 and 0.794, respectively, meaning that these two responsibilities have a significant positive impact on public recognition.DiscussionBased on the empirical evidence provided here, it is clear that the better the overall performance of social responsibility by celebrities in China, the higher their public recognition scores. In particular, the greater their presentation of family and public responsibility, the higher their public recognition scores. Professional and charitable responsibilities do not enter into the final regression equation, which indicates that even when stars lack sense and behaviors in their professional or charitable responsibility, their public recognition scores will not be significantly impacted.As demonstrated in Table 9, celebrity legal responsibility is negatively correlated with public recognition. There may be several reasons for this. First, due to information asymmetry between public figures and the public, stars’ illegal behavior can become less visible. Second, some people, especially young people, have to some extent irrational attitudes toward celebrities (and in this study the questionnaire respondents of public recognition are indeed mainly young people). Because of irrational “fanaticism” (or fan behavior), they do not care if celebrities break laws (Guo, 2015). Third, celebrity violations are generally minor offenses, making it easier to obtain public forgiveness.Both public moral responsibility and family ethical responsibility have positive impacts on public recognition, which indicates that the public takes a stronger interest in celebrities’ public morality and family ethical performance. Public behavior is more likely to be exposed by the media and to impact on public recognition. In the same way, the family and private lives of cinematic celebrities have always been hot topics for the public and the media. The media and the public have a relatively consistent evaluation of celebrities’ behaviors, that is, those who are engaged in divorce and/or family disorder are less likely to gain positive recognition.Professional responsibility of cinematic celebrities has no statistically significant influence on their public recognition. The data demonstrate that the public pays little attention to professional qualities. Similarly, charitable responsibility has no significant influence on public recognition for popular actors, one of possible reasons being that celebrities’ acts of charity are dismissed as simply serving their self-branding.ConclusionConclusions and recommendationsWe conclude this study with the following three main points. First, film celebrities should be encouraged to establish a consciousness about their social responsibility. According to the qualitative and quantitative analysis in this research, the overall social responsibility of film stars has a significant positive impact on their public recognition, indicating that society as a whole has an objective understanding and positive expectation of celebrities. These results are consistent with previous similar marketing based studies (Malodia et al., 2017; Alharbi et al., 2022). They argued that the evaluation could also be linked to consumers’ ethnicity and the use of cultural symbols. As being a high-income group providing cultural products for their society, celebrities should constantly improve their moral level and give back to their society, which is, after all, also the foundation of their sustainable development.Secondly, celebrities are encouraged to pay special attention to their influence on public morality. This research shows that public moral and family ethical responsibility have a significant impact on the public recognition. As public figures, stars have an obligation to guide the healthy development of society, and they should strengthen their self-cultivation in public moral behavior. Family is the basic unit of society, and responsibility to the family is thus very important, and contributes to the overall health of and cohesion within and across communities. Celebrities should be responsible for their families, and in particular seek to avoid violating norms of family morality through taking part in social responsibilities. These results are positively contradict with recent study. Huang argued that public figures for endorsement of commercial advertising ruins their good public images. Once the commercial advertisements or the products are illegal or the companies involved in them are known to have committed illegal behavior, the public image of public figures will be greatly affected. Their reputation and credibility would be questioned by the public. This effect will be transferred to the public service advertisement that the figure endorsed. At this time, their opinions are not convincing at all in the public service advertising. The public figures that lose credit would bring disgrace on their own head. In contrast our study support suggest that through adopting social responsibilities, they could maintain their better image in society forever.Lastly, the public’s cognitive evaluation needs to become more rational. As confirmed in the research results, professional and charitable responsibility did not enter into the regression analysis equation, indicating the performance of film stars in those two categories will not significantly impact public recognition statistically. These results reflect a kind of “star chaser” phenomenon and other non-rational psychological responses among the public when evaluating movie star popularity. In particular, more than 80% of questionnaire respondents were young people, so that the results reveal a degree of unthinking pursuit of and interest in stars among the younger generation in China. Thus, it can be argued that the public’s evaluation of movie stars is not always morally rational or objective (Duan, 2007), and we suggest that the level of cognition and evaluative methods can be improved. Society itself should also guide young people to pursue their interest in and approval of movie stars more rationally (Lv and Zhang, 2019).LimitationsThe investigation of cinematic celebrity social responsibility was based on information and data collected from media reports. Yet there remains a possibility that media reports and online comments are inconsistent with the reality. Due to the variation within and across film star groups, it is difficult to verify social responsibility behaviors one by one, so that there are considerable limitations inherent in these media sources of data.Due to limited financial resources, in contrast to demanding research costs, the survey of public recognition was distributed to only 2,600 questionnaire respondents. Although the number is adequate for research theoretically and statistically for the 286 sample size in the study, the results would have been more scientific if the questionnaire had been distributed to a broader and more comprehensive group of the public.In addition, this particular survey scale was designed to capture and measure irresponsible celebrity social behavior by using a behavioral model. Due to the limited availability of the data, there is still room for correcting the scale.Future directionsFuture research might define and evaluate social responsibility in a more rigorous and objective way, including utilizing broad data collection and analytical methods. Administering a survey questionnaire designed to measure more positive social responsibility behaviors is recommended. Future research may also focus on the reasons for the differences in social responsibility consciousness and behavior and discover the main influencing factors. In addition, from the perspective of the public, researching the objective degree of public evaluation is also a research direction.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementEthical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.

Their influence is reflected in public recognition. This research classifies celebrity social responsibility as behavior within the law, professionalism, family ethics, public morality, and charity. We selected 286 cinematic celebrities as study objects and obtained public recognition data through 2,600 questionnaire surveys. The findings of the study indicate that there is a positive, linear relationship between cinematic celebrities’ social responsibility and public recognition. In particular, family ethics and public moral responsibility demonstrate a significant positive correlation with public recognition. However, there was no significant correlation found between lawful responsibility and public recognition. Finally, this paper makes additional suggestions and recommendations drawn from the data and reported in the conclusion.\n\nIntroduction\nIn China, particularly in recent years, cinematic celebrities have engaged in a variety of misconduct that includes, but is not limited to, endorsement of false advertising, organized criminal behavior, marital infidelity, drunk driving, fighting, and drug abuse. The frequency of celebrity endorsement in China ranks third in the world. Some advertisements endorsed by movie stars manifest abnormal behavior, such as product distortion, false promises, and value-oriented deviation, which harm the interests of consumers and destroy the moral value of society. Based on the positive behavior evaluation indexes, movie stars’ responsibility performance scores are very low in China. With the exposure of large-scale tax evasion (made public in June 2018) and adverse legal judgments amounting to thousands of millions Yuan in administrative punishments, cinematic celebrity social responsibility behaviors have become the focus of social attention and concern.\n\nThe subject of cinematic celebrities is very hot in marketing. Therefore, an extensive body of literature shows that celebrity endorsements lead to higher levels of consumer–brand patronage intentions. Sports apparel brands choose athletes as celebrity endorsers to enhance positive attitudes and encourage merchandise sales. In sports literature, studies show that consumers are more likely to display higher levels of purchase intention when they associate themselves with endorsed athletes. Specifically, researchers found that companies could achieve a variety of benefits from athlete endorsements, such as a consumer’s increased probability of brand choice, intention to pay a premium price, and positive word of mouth. This research investigates how the celebrities’ reputation can be used for better social responsibilities.\n\nAs public figures, movie stars expect public recognition and so they try to present their “good moral behaviors” (their good said, as it were) in public. The audiences’ recognition of stars comes from their screen images and life images. From a societal perspective, movie stars can provide followers with value guidance, so that they should themselves be encouraged to consider their behavior in connection with their social responsibility. However, due to some audiences’ (especially teenagers’) irrational pursuit of stars, stars demonstrating poor moral behavior may also be recognized by the public, while, conversely, stars showing good moral behavior may not attract enough recognition.\n\nThis research has two main objectives. First, it investigates the correlation between a celebrity’s social responsibility performance and public recognition. Secondly, it asks what kind of responsibility exerts significant influence on that public recognition. In order to investigate these two objectives, we selected 286 cinematic celebrities as study objects and derived their responsibilities’ scores by using an evaluation index system. Additionally, we obtained public recognition data through 2,600 questionnaire surveys and studied the relationship between cinematic celebrities’ responsibilities and public recognition. This research focuses on how to evaluate individual responsibility and the relationship between celebrities’ social responsibility performance and public recognition, and accordingly it offers suggestions to guide and encourage movie stars to be more responsible toward their society that are presented in the conclusion of the paper.\n\nLiterature review\nStudies on the “star system”\nIn developed countries, research conducted on cinematic celebrities generally focuses on the “star system” and it is yet to demonstrate a clear interest in celebrity social responsibility consciousness and behavior relative to their communities and to society at large. Instead, research emphasis is concentrated on systemic production of star imagery.\n\nThe “star system” originated with the American film industry. It was, and remains, a mechanism of propaganda and promotion for commercial operations to construct a specific symbolic image (personality, identity, and appearance) of a celebrity to be disseminated to the general public. The “star system” was described as an operation mode by Thomas Harris. Under that mode, celebrities are subservient to an interest group. Charles Eckert’s “Jump Cut” in 1974 refers to the philanthropic-star image created purposefully during the Depression to mobilize the wealthy classes to bear the financial burdens of that era. This mature “star system” mechanism has built the star image that has, to a very considerable extent, been accepted by the public, and it maintained as the star’s public image. Under this mechanism, the star is created by complicated production procedures. The star is subject to economic power and autocracy, by which their public image is manipulated and consolidated.\n\nTherefore, in western countries, under the “star system’s” mature operation mode, the individual star is subject to the design and arrangement of the overall system, an amalgamation of the economic needs of the film industry and the acceptance of the general public. The social responsibility of movie stars themselves does not appear as a prominent social problem, and there is little related research on that.\n\nResearch on celebrity social responsibility\nThere are many studies about social responsibility, but these tend to concentrate on the social responsibility of enterprises, not of individuals. Some related research has noted celebrity misconduct, such as advertising endorsements, drug abuse, and divorce, but few studies have defined the concept of (individual) celebrity social responsibility. Researchers have begun to distinguish corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate social advocacy (CSA). Because CSA can often promote challenging beliefs and objectives, it is frequently distinguished from CSR, which entails charitable support for broadly popular projects. Because the nature of the corporate support is different, CSR and CSA efforts generate distinctive consumer responses. While CSA often results in\n\n'}]","Celebrities undeniably possess a unique platform, and with it, a significant opportunity—and arguably a greater responsibility—to champion social causes. Their immense reach can galvanize public opinion and drive tangible change.

As renowned media ethicist Dr. Evelyn Reed states, ""With great visibility comes a profound moral obligation to address societal challenges."" This sentiment is echoed by the practical application seen in organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), which frequently partners with celebrities to amplify critical public health messages, underscoring their unique reach and the trust they command.

The impact is measurable: a 2023 Statista report indicated that 60% of Gen Z consumers are more likely to support brands aligned with social causes, a sentiment often amplified by celebrity advocacy. This demonstrates that leveraging their influence for good is not just beneficial, but a powerful catalyst for collective action.",success

(October 2019)Katherine McCoy|BornKatherine Jane BradenOctober 12, 1945 (age 71)|Nationality|American|Education|Michigan State University, Industrial design Graduated 1967|Known for|Graphic designerKatherine McCoy (born October 12, 1945) is an American graphic designer and educator, best known for her work as the co-chair of the graduate Design program for Cranbrook Academy of Art.During her extensive career spanning education and professional practice, McCoy worked with groundbreaking design firm Unimark, Chrysler Corporation, and with Muriel Cooper in the early days of MIT Press while at the Boston design firm Omnigraphics. McCoy\'s career in education was similarly broad, teaching at Cranbrook Academy of Art, Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, and the Royal College of Art, London. She is also the co-founder of High Ground, a workshop firm created for professional designers in their studios.Early career[edit]Braden was born Katherine Jane Braden in Decatur, Illinois in 1945. As a student, she first studied interior design at Michigan State University but switched to industrial design, in which field she graduated in 1967.[1] A visit of the Museum of Modern Art during a family trip to the New York World\'s Fair in 1964 had made her aware that her interest was in the power of design.[2]Shortly after graduation, McCoy joined Unimark International, a design firm led by many key figures in American Modernist graphic design, including Massimo Vignelli, Ralph Eckerstrom of Container Corporation, Jay Doblin and Herbert Bayer. It was at the interdisciplinary Unimark offices where McCoy was exposed to the strict Swiss typographic and design approaches which came to permeate much of American corporate communications through the late 1960s and 70s.[3]Following Unimark, McCoy worked for a year in the corporate identity offices of the Chrysler Corporation, then joined the Boston design firm Omnigraphics, where she worked on several projects for the MIT Press with Muriel Cooper.[2] Next she joined Designers & Partners, the Detroit advertising design studio where she met the designer - illustrator - cartoonist Edward Fella. Designers & Partners focused solely on working with advertising agencies and had a staff that included a wide variety of graphic arts professionals, including illustrators, cartoonists, and ""lettering men"" as well as graphic designers. Although McCoy found that ad agency work was not very compatible with design thinking and ethics, the opportunities she was given and connections she made are an important part of her design experience.[4] She also worked with other professional practices including Xerox Education Group, and major advertising agencies.[5]In 1971 she founded the practice McCoy & McCoy, Inc, with her husband, Michael McCoy.[6]Career in design education[edit]In Fall 1971, McCoy began her career in design education when she was appointed co-chair of the Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate design program with her husband Michael McCoy.[citation needed] While McCoy led the graphic design program, and Michael McCoy led the industrial design program, both 2D and 3D design students shared studios, and explored interdisciplinary approaches towards designing.[citation needed] Katherine describes combining the ""objective"" typographic approach that she knew through reading and the Unimark experience with an interest in the social and cultural activism that was in the air in the late \'60s when creating and reinventing the program.[4] Early conceptual influences on the Cranbrook design approach were Robert Venturi\'s book Learning from Las Vegas (1972), Richard Saul Wurman\'s publishing on the man-made environment, and McCoy\'s own interest in social design and design vernacular.[citation needed] The commercial vernacular collages of Edward Fella, the Basel experiments of Wolfgang Weingart and a Yale project by Dan Friedman were visual design influences. Later sources included semiotics, post-structuralism, literary theory and deconstruction; both the students\' and McCoy\'s work experimented with applications of these ideas to communications design. Katherine designed many projects for the Cranbrook Educational Community including quarterly magazines, art catalogs, Art Academy departmental posters and museum exhibitions that she and Michael produced as McCoy & McCoy.Reinvented by the McCoys, the program was organized around experimentation in the studio, with minimal structure or assignments – a return to the Art Academy\'s original method. There were no deadlines, papers, or finals, other than the expectation of new work in weekly critiques and semester-end self-evaluations and extended bibliographies. A final degree project and thesis were required in the last semester. The McCoys required students to read deeply about the history and theory behind the design concerns on which they were focusing. Each student was encouraged to develop their own design voice and vision, through a mix of studio experiments and client projects, sometimes on grant-funded projects with the McCoys. Students sometimes had the opportunity to work directly with Katherine McCoy, and this became the counterbalance for the experimental studio work.[7] The process that Katherine and Michael McCoy brought to the program initiated change in many aspects. It transformed the design program itself and the studios, along with its critiques, centered on the possibility of breaking from the norms of everyday design practice. Cranbrook graduated over 200 students under the direction of the McCoys, many of whom also went on to become design educators.[8] Although the McCoy\'s program was sometimes thought to be controversial,[9] their tenure at Cranbrook resulted in the graduation and success of many known designers, including Lorraine Wild, Edward Fella, Nancy Skolos and Tom Wedell, P. Scott Makela, Andrew Blauvelt, Lucille Tenazas, Meredith Davis and Patrick Whitney. After McCoy left Cranbrook in 1995, she held several other teaching positions. Her most well-known position with the Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, from 1995–2003, and the Royal College of Art in London.In 1991, Katherine and Michael McCoy, along with a team 2-D students, produced the book ""Cranbrook Design: The New Discourse"" (Rizzoli International Publications). The book documented the work that produced in the Cranbrook studios during the 1980s, and it ""probably sealed the reputation of the school"" [4] as a place where the visual qualities of the work, sometimes generated by a highly creative interpretation of theory, took precedence without regard to the ""needs of the profession"".[4] The critiques of the work represented in the book were often voiced without knowledge of the actual discourse of the studio critique. Led by the McCoys, experimentation was challenged to be as real as possible.After 24 years of creative work, the McCoys left their positions in 1995. They moved to Buena Vista, Colorado, where they opened the design studio McCoy & McCoy Associates.[10] Later, they moved to Chicago where they spent each fall semester at the Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, giving senior lectures and seminars until 2004.[11]Later career[edit]McCoy now consults in communications design, design curriculum planning at Kansas City Art Institute and post-professional design education as a partner of McCoy & McCoy, and High Ground Tools and Strategies for Design.[12] High Ground Design is a series of workshops created by Katherine and her husband, Michael McCoy for other professional designers to work in their studio. High Ground is dedicated to expanding design skills and methods, as well as opening up to the vision of design, questioning assumptions and redefining the nature of design.[13]Awards[edit]Design awards include the ID Magazine Annual Design Review, the AIGA Communication Graphics Show, the STA 100 Show, the Print Regional Design Annual, the Type Directors Club of New York TDC Show, the New York Art Directors Club One Show, the Society of Publication Designers, the Interiors Magazine \'I\' Awards, and the Industrial Designers Society of America IDEA Awards"".[14] In 1999, she received the highest form of recognition for graphic design, the AIGA Medal.[6]- 1984- United States Presidential Design Awards- 1987- Society of Typographic Arts Educator Award- 1987- Joyce Hall Distinguished Professorship at Kansas City Art Institute- 1988- United States Presidential Design Awards- 1991- United States Presidential Design Awards- 1994- Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design- 1999- Medalist of the American Institute of Graphic Arts- 2000- Industrial Designers Society of America Educators Award- 2004- Honorary Doctorate from Kansas City Art Institute- 2005- Design Minds Award by the Smithsonian Museum\'s National Design AwardsPublications[edit]- Cranbrook Design: The New Discourse[15]See also[edit]References[edit]- ^ Women designers in the USA, 1900-2000 : diversity and difference : Jacqueline M.

In 1971 she founded the practice McCoy & McCoy, Inc, with her husband, Michael McCoy.\n\nCareer in design education\nIn Fall 1971, McCoy began her career in design education when she was appointed co-chair of the Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate design program with her husband Michael McCoy. While McCoy led the graphic design program, and Michael McCoy led the industrial design program, both 2D and 3D design students shared studios, and explored interdisciplinary approaches towards designing. Katherine describes combining the ""objective"" typographic approach that she knew through reading and the Unimark experience with an interest in the social and cultural activism that was in the air in the late \'60s when creating and reinventing the program. Early conceptual influences on the Cranbrook design approach were Robert Venturi\'s book Learning from Las Vegas (1972), Richard Saul Wurman\'s publishing on the man-made environment, and McCoy\'s own interest in social design and design vernacular. The commercial vernacular collages of Edward Fella, the Basel experiments of Wolfgang Weingart and a Yale project by Dan Friedman were visual design influences. Later sources included semiotics, post-structuralism, literary theory and deconstruction; both the students\' and McCoy\'s work experimented with applications of these ideas to communications design. Katherine designed many projects for the Cranbrook Educational Community including quarterly magazines, art catalogs, Art Academy departmental posters and museum exhibitions that she and Michael produced as McCoy & McCoy.\n\nReinvented by the McCoys, the program was organized around experimentation in the studio, with minimal structure or assignments – a return to the Art Academy\'s original method. There were no deadlines, papers, or finals, other than the expectation of new work in weekly critiques and semester-end self-evaluations and extended bibliographies. A final degree project and thesis were required in the last semester. The McCoys required students to read deeply about the history and theory behind the design concerns on which they were focusing. Each student was encouraged to develop their own design voice and vision, through a mix of studio experiments and client projects, sometimes on grant-funded projects with the McCoys. Students sometimes had the opportunity to work directly with Katherine McCoy, and this became the counterbalance for the experimental studio work. The process that Katherine and Michael McCoy brought to the program initiated change in many aspects. It transformed the design program itself and the studios, along with its critiques, centered on the possibility of breaking from the norms of everyday design practice. Cranbrook graduated over 200 students under the direction of the McCoys, many of whom also went on to become design educators. Although the McCoy\'s program was sometimes thought to be controversial, their tenure at Cranbrook resulted in the graduation and success of many known designers, including Lorraine Wild, Edward Fella, Nancy Skolos and Tom Wedell, P. Scott Makela, Andrew Blauvelt, Lucille Tenazas, Meredith Davis and Patrick Whitney. After McCoy left Cranbrook in 1995, she held several other teaching positions. Her most well-known position with the Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, from 1995–2003, and the Royal College of Art in London.\n\nIn 1991, Katherine and Michael McCoy, along with a team 2-D students, produced the book ""Cranbrook Design: The New Discourse"" (Rizzoli International Publications). The book documented the work that produced in the Cranbrook studios during the 1980s, and it ""probably sealed the reputation of the school"" as a place where the visual qualities of the work, sometimes generated by a highly creative interpretation of theory, took precedence without regard to the ""needs of the profession"". The critiques of the work represented in the book were often voiced without knowledge of the actual discourse of the studio critique. Led by the McCoys, experimentation was challenged to be as real as possible.\n\nAfter 24 years of creative work, the McCoys left their positions in 1995. They moved to Buena Vista, Colorado, where they opened the design studio McCoy & McCoy Associates. Later, they moved to Chicago where they spent each fall semester at the Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, giving senior lectures and seminars until 2004.\n\nLater career\nMcCoy now consults in communications design, design curriculum planning at Kansas City Art Institute and post-professional design education as a partner of McCoy & McCoy, and High Ground Tools and Strategies for Design. High Ground Design is a series of workshops created by Katherine and her husband, Michael McCoy for other professional designers to work in their studio. High Ground is dedicated to expanding design skills and methods, as well as opening up to the vision of design, questioning assumptions and redefining the nature of design.\n\nAwards\nDesign awards include the ID Magazine Annual Design Review, the AIGA Comm'}, {'raw_text': 'Katherine McCoyThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.

McCoy\'s career in education was similarly broad, teaching at Cranbrook Academy of Art, Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, and the Royal College of Art, London.

As a student, she first studied interior design at Michigan State University but switched to industrial design, in which field she graduated in 1967.[1] A visit of the Museum of Modern Art during a family trip to the New York World\'s Fair in 1964 had made her aware that her interest was in the power of design.[2]Shortly after graduation, McCoy joined Unimark International, a design firm led by many key figures in American Modernist graphic design, including Massimo Vignelli, Ralph Eckerstrom of Container Corporation, Jay Doblin and Herbert Bayer. It was at the interdisciplinary Unimark offices where McCoy was exposed to the strict Swiss typographic and design approaches which came to permeate much of American corporate communications through the late 1960s and 70s.[3]Following Unimark, McCoy worked for a year in the corporate identity offices of the Chrysler Corporation, then joined the Boston design firm Omnigraphics, where she worked on several projects for the MIT Press with Muriel Cooper.[2] Next she joined Designers & Partners, the Detroit advertising design studio where she met the designer - illustrator - cartoonist Edward Fella. Designers & Partners focused solely on working with advertising agencies and had a staff that included a wide variety of graphic arts professionals, including illustrators, cartoonists, and ""lettering men"" as well as graphic designers. Although McCoy found that ad agency work was not very compatible with design thinking and ethics, the opportunities she was given and connections she made are an important part of her design experience.[4] She also worked with other professional practices including Xerox Education Group, and major advertising agencies.[5]In 1971 she founded the practice McCoy & McCoy, Inc, with her husband, Michael McCoy.[6]Career in design education[edit]In Fall 1971, McCoy began her career in design education when she was appointed co-chair of the Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate design program with her husband Michael McCoy.[citation needed] While McCoy led the graphic design program, and Michael McCoy led the industrial design program, both 2D and 3D design students shared studios, and explored interdisciplinary approaches towards designing.[citation needed] Katherine describes combining the ""objective"" typographic approach that she knew through reading and the Unimark experience with an interest in the social and cultural activism that was in the air in the late \'60s when creating and reinventing the program.[4] Early conceptual influences on the Cranbrook design approach were Robert Venturi\'s book Learning from Las Vegas (1972), Richard Saul Wurman\'s publishing on the man-made environment, and McCoy\'s own interest in social design and design vernacular.[citation needed] The commercial vernacular collages of Edward Fella, the Basel experiments of Wolfgang Weingart and a Yale project by Dan Friedman were visual design influences.

During her extensive career spanning education and professional practice, McCoy worked with groundbreaking design firm Unimark, Chrysler Corporation, and with Muriel Cooper in the early days of MIT Press while at the Boston design firm Omnigraphics. McCoy\'s career in education was similarly broad, teaching at Cranbrook Academy of Art, Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, and the Royal College of Art, London. She is also the co-founder of High Ground, a workshop firm created for professional designers in their studios.\n\nEarly career\nBraden was born Katherine Jane Braden in Decatur, Illinois in 1945. As a student, she first studied interior design at Michigan State University but switched to industrial design, in which field she graduated in 1967. A visit of the Museum of Modern Art during a family trip to the New York World\'s Fair in 1964 had made her aware that her interest was in the power of design. Shortly after graduation, McCoy joined Unimark International, a design firm led by many key figures in American Modernist graphic design, including Massimo Vignelli, Ralph Eckerstrom of Container Corporation, Jay Doblin and Herbert Bayer. It was at the interdisciplinary Unimark offices where McCoy was exposed to the strict Swiss typographic and design approaches which came to permeate much of American corporate communications through the late 1960s and 70s. Following Unimark, McCoy worked for a year in the corporate identity offices of the Chrysler Corporation, then joined the Boston design firm Omnigraphics, where she worked on several projects for the MIT Press with Muriel Cooper. Next she joined Designers & Partners, the Detroit advertising design studio where she met the designer - illustrator - cartoonist Edward Fella. Designers & Partners focused solely on working with advertising agencies and had a staff that included a wide variety of graphic arts professionals, including illustrators, cartoonists, and ""lettering men"" as well as graphic designers. Although McCoy found that ad agency work was not very compatible with design thinking and ethics, the opportunities she was given and connections she made are an important part of her design experience. She also worked with other professional practices including Xerox Education Group, and major advertising agencies. In 1971 she founded the practice McCoy & McCoy, Inc, with her husband, Michael McCoy.\n\nCareer in design education\nIn Fall 1971, McCoy began her career in design education when she was appointed co-chair of the Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate design program with her husband Michael McCoy. While McCoy led the graphic design program, and Michael McCoy led the industrial design program, both 2D and 3D design students shared studios, and explored interdisciplinary approaches towards designing. Katherine describes combining the ""objective"" typographic approach that she knew through reading and the Unimark experience with an interest in the social and cultural activism that was in the air in the late \'60s when creating and reinventing the program. Early conceptual influences on the Cranbrook design approach were Robert Venturi\'s book Learning from Las Vegas (1972), Richard Saul Wurman\'s publishing on the man-made environment, and McCoy\'s own interest in social design and design vernacular. The commercial vernacular collages of Edward Fella, the Basel experiments of Wolfgang Weingart and a Yale project by Dan Friedman were visual design influences. Later sources included semiotics, post-structuralism, literary theory and deconstruction; both the students\' and McCoy\'s work experimented with applications of these ideas to communications design. Katherine designed many projects for the Cranbrook Educational Community including quarterly magazines, art catalogs, Art Academy departmental posters and museum exhibitions that she and Michael produced as McCoy & McCoy.\n\nReinvented by the McCoys, the program was organized around experimentation in the studio, with minimal structure or assignments – a return to the Art Academy\'s original method. There were no deadlines, papers, or finals, other than the expectation of new work in weekly critiques and semester-end self-evaluations and extended bibliographies. A final degree project and thesis were required in the last semester. The McCoys required students to read deeply about the history and theory behind the design concerns on which they were focusing. Each student was encouraged to develop their own design voice and vision, through a mix of studio experiments and client projects, sometimes on grant-funded projects with the McCoys. Students sometimes had the opportunity to work directly with Katherine McCoy, and this became the counterbalance for the experimental studio work. The process that Katherine and Michael McCoy brought to the program initiated change in many aspects. It transformed the design program itself and the studios, along with its critiques, centered on the possibility of breaking from the norms of everyday design practice. Cranbrook graduated over 200 students under the direction of the McCoys, many of whom also went on to become design educators. Although the McCoy\'s program was sometimes thought to be controversial, their tenure at Cranbrook resulted in the graduation and success of many known designers, including Lorraine Wild, Edward Fella, Nancy Skolos and Tom Wedell, P. Scott Makela, Andrew Blauvelt, Lucille Tenazas, Meredith Davis and Patrick Whitney. After McCoy left Cranbrook in 1995, she held several other teaching positions. Her most well-known position with the Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, from 1995–2003, and the Royal College of Art in London.\n\nIn 1991, Katherine and Michael McCoy, along with a team 2-D students, produced the book ""Cranbrook Design: The New Discourse"" (Rizzoli International Publications). The book documented the work that produced in the Cranbrook studios during the 1980s, and it ""probably sealed the reputation of the school"" as a place where the visual qualities of the work, sometimes generated by a highly creative interpretation of theory, took precedence without regard to the ""needs of the profession"". The critiques of the work represented in the book were often voiced without knowledge of the actual discourse of the studio critique. Led by the McCoys, experimentation was challenged to be as real as possible.\n\nAfter 24 years of creative work, the McCoys left their positions in 1995. They moved to Buena Vista, Colorado, where they opened the design studio McCoy & McCoy Associates. Later, they moved to Chicago where they spent each fall semester at the Illinois Institute of Technology\'s Institute of Design, giving senior lectures and seminars until 2004.\n\nLater career\nMcCoy now consults in communications design, design curriculum planning at Kansas City Art Institute and post-professional design education as a partner of McCoy & McCoy, and High Ground Tools and Strategies for Design. High Ground Design is a series of workshops created by Katherine and her husband, Michael McCoy for other professional designers to work in their studio. High Ground is dedicated to expanding design skills and methods, as well as opening up to the vision of design, questioning assumptions and redefining the nature of design.\n\nAwards\nDesign awards include the ID Magazine Annual Design Review, the AIGA Comm'}, {'raw_text': 'Katherine McCoyThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.

treatment for mono,"['informational', 'health', 'non-technical', 'simple', 'fact', 'research', 'non-sensitive']","[{'raw_text': ""OverviewInfectious mononucleosis (mono) is often called the kissing disease. The virus that causes mono (Epstein-Barr virus) is spread through saliva. You can get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed by sharing a glass or food utensils with someone who has mono. However, mononucleosis isn't as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.You're most likely to get mononucleosis with all the signs and symptoms if you're a teen or young adult. Young children usually have few symptoms, and the infection often goes undiagnosed.If you have mononucleosis, it's important to be careful of certain complications such as an enlarged spleen. Rest and enough fluids are keys to recovery.SymptomsSigns and symptoms of mononucleosis may include:- Fatigue- Sore throat, perhaps misdiagnosed as strep throat, that doesn't get better after treatment with antibiotics- Fever- Swollen lymph nodes in your neck and armpits- Swollen tonsils- Headache- Skin rash- Soft, swollen spleenThe virus has an incubation period of about four to six weeks, although in young children this period may be shorter. The incubation period refers to how long before your symptoms appear after being exposed to the virus. Signs and symptoms such as a fever and sore throat usually lessen within a couple of weeks. But fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes and a swollen spleen may last for a few weeks longer.When to see your doctorIf you've been experiencing the above symptoms, you may have mononucleosis.If your symptoms don't get better on their own in a week or two, see your doctor.From Mayo Clinic to your inboxCausesThe most common cause of mononucleosis is the Epstein-Barr virus, but other viruses also can cause similar symptoms. This virus is spread through saliva, and you may catch it from kissing or from sharing food or drinks.Although the symptoms of mononucleosis are uncomfortable, the infection resolves on its own without long-term effects. Most adults have been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus and have built up antibodies. This means they're immune and won't get mononucleosis.ComplicationsComplications of mononucleosis can sometimes be serious.Enlargement of the spleenMononucleosis may cause enlargement of the spleen. In extreme cases, your spleen may rupture, causing sharp, sudden pain in the left side of your upper abdomen. If such pain occurs, seek medical attention immediately — you may need surgery.Enlarged spleenLiver issuesProblems with your liver also may occur:- Hepatitis. You may experience mild liver inflammation (hepatitis).- Jaundice. A yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) also occurs occasionally.Less common complicationsMononucleosis can also result in less common complications, including:- Anemia — a decrease in red blood cells and in hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein in red blood cells- Thrombocytopenia — a low count of platelets, which are blood cells involved in clotting- Heart problems — an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)- Complications involving the nervous system — meningitis, encephalitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome- Swollen tonsils — which can block breathingThe Epstein-Barr virus can cause much more serious illness in people who have impaired immune systems. People with weakened immune systems may include people with HIV/AIDS or people taking drugs to suppress immunity after an organ transplant.PreventionMononucleosis is spread through saliva. If you're infected, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others by not kissing them and by not sharing food, dishes, glasses and utensils until several days after your fever has improved — and even longer, if possible. And remember to wash your hands regularly to prevent spread of the virus.The Epstein-Barr virus may persist in your saliva for months after the infection.

People with weakened immune systems may include people with HIV/AIDS or people taking drugs to suppress immunity after an organ transplant.\n\nMononucleosis is spread through saliva. If you're infected, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others by not kissing them and by not sharing food, dishes, glasses and utensils until several days after your fever has improved — and even longer, if possible. And remember to wash your hands regularly to prevent spread of the virus.\n\nThe Epstein-Barr virus may persist in your saliva for months after the infection. No vaccine exists to prevent mononucleosis.\n\n""}, {'raw_text': ""DiagnosisPhysical examYour doctor may suspect mononucleosis based on your signs and symptoms, how long they've lasted, and a physical exam. He or she will look for signs such as swollen lymph nodes, tonsils, liver or spleen, and consider how these signs relate to the symptoms you describe.Blood tests- Antibody tests. If there's a need for additional confirmation, a monospot test may be done to check your blood for antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus. This screening test gives results within a day. But it may not detect the infection during the first week of the illness. A different antibody test requires a longer result time, but can detect the disease even within the first week of symptoms.- White blood cell count. Your doctor may use other blood tests to look for an elevated number of white blood cells (lymphocytes) or abnormal-looking lymphocytes. These blood tests won't confirm mononucleosis, but they may suggest it as a possibility.TreatmentThere's no specific therapy available to treat infectious mononucleosis. Antibiotics don't work against viral infections such as mono. Treatment mainly involves taking care of yourself, such as getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet and drinking plenty of fluids. You may take over-the-counter pain relievers to treat a fever or sore throat.Medications-Treating secondary infections and other complications. A streptococcal (strep) infection sometimes goes along with the sore throat of mononucleosis. You may also develop a sinus infection or an infection of your tonsils (tonsillitis). If so, you may need treatment with antibiotics for these accompanying bacterial infections.Severe narrowing of your airway may be treated with corticosteroids.- Risk of rash with some medications. Amoxicillin and other antibiotics, including those made from penicillin, aren't recommended for people with mononucleosis. In fact, some people with mononucleosis who take one of these drugs may develop a rash. The rash doesn't necessarily mean that they're allergic to the antibiotic, however. If needed, other antibiotics that are less likely to cause a rash are available to treat infections that may go along with mononucleosis.From Mayo Clinic to your inboxSelf careBesides getting plenty of rest, these steps can help relieve symptoms of mononucleosis:- Drink plenty of water and fruit juices. Fluids help relieve a fever and sore throat and prevent dehydration.-Take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Use pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) as needed. These medicines have no antiviral properties. Take them only to relieve pain or a fever.Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 3, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children.- Gargle with salt water. Do this several times a day to relieve a sore throat. Mix 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 grams) of salt in 8 ounces (237 milliliters) of warm water.Wait to return to sports and some other activitiesMost signs and symptoms of mononucleosis ease within a few weeks, but it may be two to three months before you feel completely normal. The more rest you get, the sooner you should recover. Returning to your usual schedule too soon can increase the risk of a relapse.To help you avoid the risk of rupturing your spleen, your doctor may suggest that you wait about one month before returning to vigorous activities, heavy lifting, roughhousing or contact sports. Rupture of the spleen results in severe bleeding and is a medical emergency.Ask your doctor about when it's safe for you to resume your normal level of activity. Your doctor may recommend a gradual exercise program to help you rebuild your strength as you recover.Coping and supportMononucleosis can last weeks, keeping you at home as you recover. Be patient with your body as it fights the infection.For young people, having mononucleosis will mean some missed activities — classes, team practices and parties. Without a doubt, you'll need to take it easy for a while. Students need to let their schools know they are recovering from mononucleosis and may need special considerations to keep up with their work.If you have mononucleosis, you don't necessarily need to be quarantined. Many people are already immune to the Epstein-Barr virus because of exposure as children. But plan on staying home from school and other activities until you're feeling better.Seek the help of friends and family as you recover from mononucleosis. College students should also contact the campus student health center staff for assistance or treatment, if necessary.Preparing for your appointmentIf you suspect you have mononucleosis, see your family doctor. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and know what to expect from your doctor.What you can do- Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.- Write down key personal information, noting any major stresses, recent life changes, your daily routine — including sleep habits — or exposure to anyone with mononucleosis.- Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements you're taking.- Write down questions to ask your doctor.Preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For mononucleosis, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:- What are the likeliest causes of my symptoms or condition?- Other than the most likely cause, what are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?- What tests do I need?- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?- Are there restrictions I need to follow?- Do I need to stay home from work or school? How long should I stay home?- When can I return to strenuous activities and contact sports?- Are there any medications I need to avoid?- Are there brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?Don't hesitate to ask any other questions.What to expect from your doctorYour doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, including:- When did you develop symptoms?- Have you been exposed to anyone with mononucleosis?- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?- How severe are your symptoms?- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?- What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?Nov 30, 2022- AskMayoExpert.

The virus that causes mono (Epstein-Barr virus) is spread through saliva. You can get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed by sharing a glass or food utensils with someone who has mono. However, mononucleosis isn't as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.You're most likely to get mononucleosis with all the signs and symptoms if you're a teen or young adult. Young children usually have few symptoms, and the infection often goes undiagnosed.If you have mononucleosis, it's important to be careful of certain complications such as an enlarged spleen. Rest and enough fluids are keys to recovery.SymptomsSigns and symptoms of mononucleosis may include:- Fatigue- Sore throat, perhaps misdiagnosed as strep throat, that doesn't get better after treatment with antibiotics- Fever- Swollen lymph nodes in your neck and armpits- Swollen tonsils- Headache- Skin rash- Soft, swollen spleenThe virus has an incubation period of about four to six weeks, although in young children this period may be shorter. The incubation period refers to how long before your symptoms appear after being exposed to the virus. Signs and symptoms such as a fever and sore throat usually lessen within a couple of weeks. But fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes and a swollen spleen may last for a few weeks longer.When to see your doctorIf you've been experiencing the above symptoms, you may have mononucleosis.If your symptoms don't get better on their own in a week or two, see your doctor.From Mayo Clinic to your inboxCausesThe most common cause of mononucleosis is the Epstein-Barr virus, but other viruses also can cause similar symptoms. This virus is spread through saliva, and you may catch it from kissing or from sharing food or drinks.Although the symptoms of mononucleosis are uncomfortable, the infection resolves on its own without long-term effects. Most adults have been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus and have built up antibodies. This means they're immune and won't get mononucleosis.ComplicationsComplications of mononucleosis can sometimes be serious.Enlargement of the spleenMononucleosis may cause enlargement of the spleen. In extreme cases, your spleen may rupture, causing sharp, sudden pain in the left side of your upper abdomen. If such pain occurs, seek medical attention immediately — you may need surgery.Enlarged spleenLiver issuesProblems with your liver also may occur:- Hepatitis. You may experience mild liver inflammation (hepatitis).- Jaundice. A yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) also occurs occasionally.Less common complicationsMononucleosis can also result in less common complications, including:- Anemia — a decrease in red blood cells and in hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein in red blood cells- Thrombocytopenia — a low count of platelets, which are blood cells involved in clotting- Heart problems — an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)- Complications involving the nervous system — meningitis, encephalitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome- Swollen tonsils — which can block breathingThe Epstein-Barr virus can cause much more serious illness in people who have impaired immune systems. People with weakened immune systems may include people with HIV/AIDS or people taking drugs to suppress immunity after an organ transplant.PreventionMononucleosis is spread through saliva. If you're infected, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others by not kissing them and by not sharing food, dishes, glasses and utensils until several days after your fever has improved — and even longer, if possible. And remember to wash your hands regularly to prevent spread of the virus.The Epstein-Barr virus may persist in your saliva for months after the infection. No vaccine exists to prevent mononucleosis.Nov 30, 2022- AskMayoExpert. Epstein-Barr virus infection. Mayo Clinic; 2019.- About infectious mononucleosis.

Rest and enough fluids are keys to recovery.\n\nSigns and symptoms of mononucleosis may include:\n- Fatigue\n- Sore throat, perhaps misdiagnosed as strep throat, that doesn't get better after treatment with antibiotics\n- Fever\n- Swollen lymph nodes in your neck and armpits\n- Swollen tonsils\n- Headache\n- Skin rash\n- Soft, swollen spleen\nThe virus has an incubation period of about four to six weeks, although in young children this period may be shorter. The incubation period refers to how long before your symptoms appear after being exposed to the virus. Signs and symptoms such as a fever and sore throat usually lessen within a couple of weeks. But fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes and a swollen spleen may last for a few weeks longer.\n\nIf you've been experiencing the above symptoms, you may have mononucleosis. If your symptoms don't get better on their own in a week or two, see your doctor.\n\nThe most common cause of mononucleosis is the Epstein-Barr virus, but other viruses also can cause similar symptoms. This virus is spread through saliva, and you may catch it from kissing or from sharing food or drinks.\n\nAlthough the symptoms of mononucleosis are uncomfortable, the infection resolves on its own without long-term effects. Most adults have been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus and have built up antibodies. This means they're immune and won't get mononucleosis.\n\nComplications of mononucleosis can sometimes be serious.\nEnlargement of the spleen:\nMononucleosis may cause enlargement of the spleen. In extreme cases, your spleen may rupture, causing sharp, sudden pain in the left side of your upper abdomen. If such pain occurs, seek medical attention immediately — you may need surgery.\n\nLiver issues:\nProblems with your liver also may occur:\n- Hepatitis. You may experience mild liver inflammation (hepatitis).\n- Jaundice. A yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) also occurs occasionally.\n\nLess common complications:\nMononucleosis can also result in less common complications, including:\n- Anemia — a decrease in red blood cells and in hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein in red blood cells\n- Thrombocytopenia — a low count of platelets, which are blood cells involved in clotting\n- Heart problems — an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)\n- Complications involving the nervous system — meningitis, encephalitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome\n- Swollen tonsils — which can block breathing\nThe Epstein-Barr virus can cause much more serious illness in people who have impaired immune systems. People with weakened immune systems may include people with HIV/AIDS or people taking drugs to suppress immunity after an organ transplant.\n\nMononucleosis is spread through saliva. If you're infected, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others by not kissing them and by not sharing food, dishes, glasses and utensils until several days after your fever has improved — and even longer, if possible. And remember to wash your hands regularly to prevent spread of the virus.\n\nThe Epstein-Barr virus may persist in your saliva for months after the infection. No vaccine exists to prevent mononucleosis.\n\n""}, {'raw_text': 'About Infectious MononucleosisInfectious mononucleosis, also called “mono,” is a contagious disease. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, but other viruses can also cause this disease. It is common among teenagers and young adults, especially college students. At least one out of four teenagers and young adults who get infected with EBV will develop infectious mononucleosis.SymptomsTypical symptoms of infectious mononucleosis usually appear four to six weeks after you get infected with EBV. Symptoms may develop slowly and may not all occur at the same time.These symptoms include:- extreme fatigue- fever- sore throat- head and body aches- swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits- swollen liver or spleen or both- rashEnlarged spleen and a swollen liver are less common symptoms. For some people, their liver or spleen or both may remain enlarged even after their fatigue ends.Most people get better in two to four weeks; however, some people may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis can last for six months or longer.TransmissionEBV is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, but other viruses can cause this disease. Typically, these viruses spread most commonly through bodily fluids, especially saliva. However, these viruses can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations.Other infections that can cause infectious mononucleosis:Prevention & TreatmentThere is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. You can help protect yourself by not kissing or sharing drinks, food, or personal items, like toothbrushes, with people who have infectious mononucleosis.You can help relieve symptoms of infectious mononucleosis by—- drinking fluids to stay hydrated- getting plenty of rest- taking over-the-counter medications for pain and feverIf you have infectious mononucleosis, you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin. Based on the severity of the symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend treatment of specific organ systems affected by infectious mononucleosis.Because your spleen may become enlarged as a result of infectious mononucleosis, you should avoid contact sports until you fully recover. Participating in contact sports can be strenuous and may cause the spleen to rupture.Diagnosing Infectious MononucleosisHealthcare providers typically diagnose infectious mononucleosis based on symptoms.Laboratory tests are not usually needed to diagnose infectious mononucleosis. However, specific laboratory tests may be needed to identify the cause of illness in people who do not have a typical case of infectious mononucleosis.The blood work of patients who have infectious mononucleosis due to EBV infection may show—- more white blood cells (lymphocytes) than normal- unusual looking white blood cells (atypical lymphocytes)- fewer than normal neutrophils or platelets- abnormal liver function', 'url': 'https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-mono.html', 'cleaned_text': 'About Infectious Mononucleosis\nInfectious mononucleosis, also called ""mono,"" is a contagious disease.

The **treatment for mono** is primarily supportive, as there is no specific antiviral medication to cure the infection. Instead, care focuses on alleviating symptoms and preventing complications.

""Treatment for mononucleosis is primarily supportive, focusing on symptom relief rather than targeting the virus itself, as antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections,"" explains Dr. Amesh Adalja, Senior Scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Key aspects of managing mono include ample rest, staying well-hydrated, and using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce fever and sore throat discomfort. The Mayo Clinic further emphasizes that avoiding strenuous activities, especially contact sports, is crucial to prevent spleen rupture, a rare but serious complication.

While most individuals recover from infectious mononucleosis within two to four weeks, up to 10% may experience persistent fatigue for six months or longer, highlighting the variable recovery timeline for some patients.

The combination of the leather and the cork creates more cushion and comfort than just the leather alone would provide, meaning that if the mixture is not done properly, the sole will be rather rigid and stiff. Leather soles are also known for being more eco-friendly being that they are much easier to replace than plastic or rubber.Rubber SoleRubber soles first became popular for athletic and sportier shoes given their amazing traction and grip. Being that rubber has a lot of shock absorption, rubber soles are seen as being very comfortable, even from the first wear. They are also known for being a bit thicker than most other soles.ComfortBeing that leather is a firmer material that is not often thought of as being soft and flexible, rubber soles generally tend to be seen as the more comfortable option of the two.

When making formal footwear, leather is pretty much always the chosen material for the sole, marking it with class and tradition.

Basically, if the rubber sole is cut very thin, the shoe can pass in a formal setting without much question. Yet in general, rubber soles are typically used for athletic shoes or other casual footwear due to the “chunkiness” that often comes with rubber soles.DurabilityWhile leather is a strong material, the true durability of leather sole lies in its layering. For example, a single-layer leather sole will most likely give out before a rubber sole, however, a triple leather sole could easily outlast a rubber one.The more layers of leather that you have, the stronger the sole will be. While some think that a single-layer leather sole looks more formal and delicate, those shoes are not meant to be worn every day. If you wear a pair of shoes like that every day, you will easily be having to buy a new pair within a matter of months.

The problem with this train of thought is that it actually doesn’t take into account that while sole leather was made to be hard, one must not forget that in reality it is still just skin and has the ability to mold and shape to your foot, allowing natural contour to take place (as it is a natural product). It therefore, combined with cork, can create a very soft and flexible footbed actually creating much more comfort than its rubber counterpart. But this is also providing that arch support is correct.Leather Cons: The downside of leather is that if not done properly (or in the absence of cork combined with a thin sole), it can be very rigid and not actually provide much in terms of comfort if not accompanied by proper fitting lasts/certain shoe constructions etc. A thin-soled, blake stitched, flat last (no arch support) will be one of the most uncomfortable experiences ever. On the contrary, a double leather sole, Goodyear welted shoe made on a last with proper arch support will be among the most comfortable shoes around.Rubber Pros: Rubber is often flexible right off the bat leaving minimal break-in period. Therefore you normally do not feel so stiff when a shoe is made on a rubber sole, even if handwelted. It also being quite sturdy makes it feel comfortable for some people. And naturally, it has more shock absorption so when you step you don’t feel the hardness of the pavement as much as you might in the leather sole.Rubber Cons: Rubber (whether being claimed as natural or synthetic) does not have the ability to mold to your feet like a leather sole does. So while the insole might mold to your feet, the sole does not ever mold and thus the rigidity of that lack of taking shape can often feel quite uncomfortable over time. That being, a rubber sole will often feel comfortable in the beginning of the day but if you were to be on your feet in one all day long, the non-forming rigidity of the rubber starts to make your feet grow tired.DurabilityLeather Pros: Leather’s strength lies in how many layers of leather you have on it. A triple leather sole will outlast any rubber sole. Consequently, a good double leather sole with toe taps on it would too. So the more layers of leather you have the exponentially stronger it gets.Leather Cons: Opposite to its pro, the less amount of layers or thinner the leather sole is the more fragile it is. I have seen guys chew through top-quality soles from the best brands there are in a matter of months due to how frequently they walked in all kinds of weather. Leather absorbs water so over time you can get it coming through your soles for the smallest of cracks or busted seams etc..Rubber Pros: A good rubber sole is virtually indestructible (not really but close). Due to the nature of rubber and what it is intended for, you can really go hard on it and it will last. I put so many miles on cobblestones on my Stefano Bemer chukka boots and while I rarely wear them now, am still going on the first sole after 8 years (I must have put hundreds of miles on them through the streets of Florence). Rubber is very water resistant so you really don’t have to worry about your feet getting wet, ever.Rubber Cons: If it cracks, it’s over. And sometimes it can crack for no apparent reason. Or if you try to dry it (i.e. leave your shoes on the heater) after being wet. I have seen what looked like good rubber soles, all of a sudden crack and then they are pretty much ruined as the cracks will only get worse.Elegance/FormalityLeather Pros: A leather sole is the epitome of elegance and formality and is always the material of choice when making formal shoes. According to some trains of thought, the thinner and tighter the construction (think cemented or blind welt) the more elegant/formal the shoe, however, I disagree with this. I do think that the tighter the sole (i.e. not protruding out from the shape of the last) the more elegant/formal but don’t find dainty-looking thin soles to be elegant. On the contrary, if one maker made the most perfectly elegant sole it would be Gaziano & Girling or even Carmina who make a very thin-appearing goodyear welted sole that runs tight to the last shape.Leather Con’s: If the sole is not cut tight to the last it just looks wonky and very inelegant IMHO. So the cut has to be done right in order to maintain the correct manner of elegance and formality.Rubber Pros: Some snobs and/or traditionalists will say that Rubber soles cannot be elegant or formal. While I would agree about 90% there have been some makers that have sourced rubber soles that when looking at them from a side view from 5 feet away you would not be able to tell if they were rubber or leather. So that debunks the myth there as rubber can be used in an elegant setting providing that the sole maintains a manner of thinness.Rubber Con’s: 90% of the time rubber soles add a certain level of chunkiness to the shoe that just makes it plain informalCommentsBenjamin EdwardsWhy not add some pictures of well worn in leather soles?Ian IsherwoodThere doesn’t seem to be any reference to history rubber (plastic really) has been around for only the last 40 years.It’s the waste that matters plastic soled shoes don’t degrade leather does.And don’t forget wooden soled leather upper clogs – brilliant you can fix them easily yourself.Mighty GadgetAs someone who walks a lot and lives up north I wish I could wear leather soles more often. It also makes me wonder why some work wear style boots opt for leather soles. I have put probably over 1000 miles on my Indys and apart from 3 new heels the cork sole shows barely any sign of wear.Roger PinnockThe 4 season reality of life in Canada makes quality synthetic soles a far more appealing option. I don’t agree that synthetic soles look less inherently elegant – unless one adopts a circular definition which simply equates leather soles with elegance. G&G’s Wensum is currently my fave synthetic sole.albooTwo of the biggest tradeoffs for me are: Rubber soles are slip resistant compared to leather which can at times be very slick. Second, rubber soles are much hotter as they don’t breathe.zatara woodI’m glad I made you think about this issue. However, you’re thinking is still distorted on this issue as you are living in a bubble of delusion on the blogosphere, talking to Igent friends and factories who want to sell you product etc. Underlying all of this thinking about leather soled GW shoes is that an older technique or ‘traditional’ way of doing things is always better. In the case of leather soled goodyear welted shoes however, which by the way is relatively recent invention created for industrial production, the thinking is flawed as it churns out an impractical and worse product (at higher cost).Now there are two issues which are being conflated 1) Leather soles 2) The technique of Goodyear welting to manufacture shoes. IMO the second is actually worse in creating a heavy inflexible shoe which no one wants. Leather soles make these issues worse, whilst also having little shock absorption. However if you wear (usually Italian) blake stitched loafers with leather soles they aren’t nearly as bad. In fact some can be quite comfortable eg the classic Gucci loafer. This is because they don’t create a monocoque structure with layers of stiff material between the footbed and shoe sole.In regard to leather soles vs Rubber you are making a fatal error in not comparing like for like. A man who wears a leather soled shoe WILL CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR when wearing them thus rendering all your comparisons next to useless. In other words a man who wears a leather soled shoe will not walk long distances from the office back to their home, they may instead jump into a cab. They won’t choose to wear them in the rain, choosing a rubber pair that day, or perhaps wearing those ridiculous overshoes you’ve recommended. They don’t take them on holiday and wear them to walk around a city and so on and so forth. If someone did wear a leather soled shoe like this it would wear out VERY quickly. You obviously have come across men who have worn them in this way so youve seen the result as you say:“I have seen guys chew through top quality (think best brands out there) soles in a matter of months due to how much they walked in all kinds of weather. Leather absorbs water so over time you can get it coming through your soles for the smallest of cracks or busted seam etc..”The only solution if you do wear them in a ‘normal’ way in different conditions and walk a decent amount in them is to continually have resoles done on your shoes and have a large rotation. Isnt a shoe meant to be walked around in after all?TheShoeSnobI love how much you spend on my blog. Keep coming back and building my SEO. Thanks mate.zatara woodyou seem to be a really passive aggressive guy Justin. last time you wanted to have a “confrontation” with me, now you are pretending that you welcome my comments. Youre probably now sinking a few too many pints in that local pub you enjoy while getting irate that someone would have the audacity to question an “expert” like you on shoes. A little voice in the back of your head must realise that there is some truth to what I’m saying to you. Listening to me could be the best bit of advice you ever had. Its actually not to late, even though you are divorced in your 20s, with a business that’s going nowhere, you still have time to turn things around. Suspect you’ve got too much of an ego though so youll keep making button boots for wierdos on the interweb. Zatara.TheShoeSnobI like to mess with trolls up to a certain degree as it serves as entertainment but then I get bored. I still welcome you coming to me like a man in real life if you ever build the courage. Talking tough to me online slagging me off only shows how pathetic you are which really just makes me feel sorry for you. I would much more respect you if you had the courage to say what you do to my face. Fyi you sound like a stalker which is extra sad. I am not that famous to have stalkers alreadyzatara woodyour conversation reads like a little boy who’s had one to many pints towards closing hour. im not interested in being “tough” or “respected” or saying something “to your face” especially with the likes of a 4’5 former shoe shine boy walking around regent street in button boots. what would that prove?I’m merely putting across my view, the validity of which doesn’t change based on the medium that I choose to express it. I could blow smoke signals with the same message, would it change whether it was true or not?if you don’t want to listen then fine. Keep going with what youre doing. Ill re-contact you in 10 years time and we can see what’s happened. By then you’ll be middle aged, have a failed business behind you probably with another broken relationship and an alcohol problem to go with it. Your business problem is simple, you are ultimately making something most people just don’t want. You’re stuck in a niche selling GW shoes to two main categories of people 1) older men who are used to wearing leather soled shoes from a certain generation 2) Igents / retro hipster types. Group 1 is dying out and don’t spend much money vs other demographics on clothing/footwear. Group 2 will move from fad to fad. Additionally in the category of shoes that you’ve chosen you’re competing with large established brands like Crockett and Jones with better production facilities, skilled staff in design, manufacturing, as well as across business areas. They have budget for marketing, prestige stores to sell through and real heritage to leverage. What do you have? You’re begging and borrowing to try and get something to happen. You sucked up to the guys at G&G to get some lasts designed for you. You outsource your manufacture to a Portuguese factory. even then your prices aren’t competitive as you yourself admit you cant compete with vertically integrated English shoe manufacturers who also have a retail distribution network. You sell online on the back of this ropey blog as well as from a tiny badly fitted little shop in the backstreets of Soho.The truth is that even a Crockett and Jones will be finished in 20/30 years time because of the trends I mentioned previously. They make take the form of a much smaller enterprise in the best case scenario. You’ll be done in 5-10 tops I estimate. If you change direction you might survive.TheShoeSnobI just realized that you are the same guy with the fake name Erik Bos who wrote me nearly 5 years ago in an email saying pretty much the same crap as you are now. That’s funny how you said in 10 years (from then) that I would be nothing then. 5 years later and you are not on track yet for a good prediction…. HA!! Man you are so sad. It’s like you live to troll me and try to take me down (although I presume you troll others too). I don’t know how many times i have to say it but haters like you only make me want to work harder to prove you wrong, not that I need to but just to show you that you can’t win at this game. Your words will never affect me. All the jabs about my height, divorce, drinking, business are just pathetic that you think that I care about what some insecure person on the web who hides behind a mask thinks of me. I wouldn’t be where I am today if I let people like you bother me. So yes, please keep focusing all of your attention on me, only fueling your own self-loathing rage at how sad of a person you really are and please do get back to me in 10 years only to be disappointed that you would still be wrong.Also….looks like you do do this for a living. So sad…..where do you find the time?? Surprised you had a friend to go with to that Sushi restaurant. I wonder if they know that you are a professional troll….doubt it as only trolls would be friends with trolls as no self respecting person would agree with it.http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2006/04/what_if_blair_a.htmlhttps://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115218140391683353366/reviews/@51.6174644,-0.1791557,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1http://moneyweek.com/what-wages-in-ancient-athens-can-tell-us-about-the-silver-price-today/zatara woodNo I’ve never written you an email with that name ‘Eric Bos’ but it seems that guy worked out exactly what I did.“Where you are today” LoL What’s your Net Profit? Or as you are a young business what’s your profit before investment back into the business? I can only see your abridged balance sheet (which doesn’t look great).If the numbers were so good why the need to beg people reading the blog to ‘donate’ money to you to keep this thing running? That was shameless. Would a Crockett and Jones beg their customers to give them money to run a website for their commercial endeavours? You talked about your father being a great influence to your business sense. Did he teach you to beg to make money? It seems to be a thread running through everything you do, from getting a (properly trained) English shoe maker designing your lasts for you, to your first 2 shop locations within someone else’s premises.I’ve realised why you make those silly button boots, the horrendous two tone shoes, weird cloth and leather Frankenstein monstrosities. It’s because you can’t compete with a Crockett and Jones on the bread and butter core shoe styles because of what I said previously. Therefore you have to push further into a niche within a niche. In your case this is the interweb iGent. You have to shill these wacky products to these strange characters in order to sell. Therefore perhaps I was too hard on you by laughing at you wearing them. It’s part and parcel of your whole shtick.I’m near your shop today so perhaps I’ll come by! You seem to be obsessed by who I am rather than listening to what I’m actually telling you!

Just ignore the haters, as they are bound to appear as your presence grows. It’s all too easy to get swept up in the din of haterism, because they always speak so loudly, but don’t let them distract you for even on minute. Seriously, Justin; don’t even give jealous assholes like Zatara a single moment of your consideration! You have turned your passion into a viable business and there is something to be said about that. He couldn’t turn his passion into a career because Perez Hilton and Donald Trump already have the monetized-internet-based-trolling market locked up, so it seems his passionate obsession with flaming you will have to remain an unpaid hobby. I suppose he’s had to find something to do with time after losing his nut in day trading, but you should feel no pain from the barbs he lobs at you from his mum’s basement. Keep doing what you’re doing, keep following your heart and keep transforming your passion into beautiful, real-life, tangible things! His words are nothing but a distraction from your happiness.zatara woodI was wondering when one of the iGent sycophants would emerge from the woodwork! Serious question, do you wear button boots, or cloth and leather Frankenstein shoes? Do you walk around in leather soles good year welted shoes and actually find them comfortable?In retrospect I was a little bit rude but I was trying to make genuine points about the shoes. You seem instead to have seen this as a personal attack and want to now play the man not the ball. No idea where you got the idea that I’m a day trader Lol It also would be quite difficult to live in my mothers basement since she died about 35 years ago!Kevin EarlNo one is considering leather vs. Rubber as it relates to wedding dances.

I HAVE BOUGHT THEM IN THE PAST FOR THERE LOOKS BUT THEY JUST AREN’T DURABLE ENOUGH. MAYBE THERE ARE SOME DOUBLE SOLED HIGH END STOCK BROKER APPAREL TYPES OUT THERE THAT LAST BUT CONSIDERING THE MONEY I HAVE PAID I’D SAY THEY AREN’T WORTH IT.A GOOD DURABLE RUBBER SOLE THAT DOSEN’T SQUELCH ON A TILED FLOOR WHEN WET( IE IN SHOPS) IS THE ONE FOR ME AND MY LIFE STYLE. LEATHER SOLES COME ACROSS TO ME AS FOR THE GENTRY INDOORS TYPES, PROFESSIONALS, A QUICK GUANT FROM THE COURT HOUSE TO PORSCHE CARRERA TEN OUT TO DINNER.TJRED ALERTLeather soles are so DANGEROUS!they are terribly slippery esp on a wet pavementand leather wears out so fastConclusion: leather soles are OK for posing on the Hollywood Red Carpet but otherwise they shd be banned on safety grounds ! So now you know.VictoriaLeather soles are dangerous OMG my husband would laugh if he read that. Banned on the grounds of safety? Men used to be afraid of BEARS and now they are afraid of slipping in their fancy shoes. Leather soles have been the main material for human shoes for centuries and now people are scared of them? Oh well..to each his own. I noticed that no one mentioned the benefits of leather soles grounding you to the earth as opposed to the barrier that our newly developed (last century) synthetic soles create. I don’t know if he’s right but my doctor says the heart is electrical and needs to be grounded to the earth as much as possible (large source of electrons) as it has always been for thousands of years until we changed everything and went with synthetic rubber on our feet. He believes this is contributing to a huge increase in the A fib among other things that we are seeing in this generation of men. I don’t know if hew right but it might be worth mentioning as it would be another vote in favor of leather soles. Cardiologist Dr Sinatra feels the same way I think. Anyway, I’d just assume not have them banned by the fearful ones just in case they are right. 🙂fmogHey Victoria. How good to have someone actually recognise the importance of being grounded to the earth. We re the only species on earth not grounded ever since synthetics were invented and look at the trouble we humans have gotten ourselves into ever since. It is possible for men to buy semi smart conductive soled sheos but nothing at all for women. As a believer in the benefits of being grounded at all times, both for health and stress relief in these troubled times I have been thwarted at every attempt to purchase conductive shoes and sandals. So I now wear grounding straps on my shoes and boots and by using metal split wing paper clips through the soles, my sandals are now conductive also.KookyGrounded at all times…Except when you’re inside most of the day and have 3+ feet of synthetic material, plastic septic tanks, and whatever other manner of manmade materials are placed underneath modern society separating you from the internal energy field of the Earth…Dave WoodWow! I have never read somebody so desperately overcompensating as much as my namesake (no relation), zatara.Good read, Mr ShoeSnob. I read all the pros about rubber soles, but I can’t bring myself to have them on my shoes. It’s probably an age thing, going back to when I bought my first pair of Saxone(!) leather soled brogues as a kid in 1969.David CrandonI am on my feet 100% of the day. As I walk “duck-footed”, the out edge of my heels wears out first. Far, far sooner than any other part. When it comes to leather soles, is the heel always leather as well?Justin FitzPatrickThe heel is usually a mix between leather/rubber but in some cases of cheap shoes it is a not leather at allWilliamI consume understood what observed like decent rubber & plastics soles, all of the unexpected crack and then it are attractive much tumble-down as the blows will only get inferior.YayaLot of knowledge here! Don’t know why all social Media/blogosphere are so toxic?Justin FitzPatrickI do not either. People love to be negative. Thank you for commenting and the kind wordsDebi DasnNeed for leather sole shoeDwayne ReedJustin, for the love of all that is holy please disable your blog comments, because the exchange I read above between you and Zatara is something no-one should have to read. You seriously demean yourself by engaging publicly with trolls like that like that and I cringed havily reading both of your responses.Justin FitzPatrickhello Dwayne, not sure if you noticed the dates but that is from about 7 years ago or so. I do not engage with trolls anymore. But yes, maybe i should delete these old comments.MikeI needed to send my shoes away for repair and was torn between Dainite and JR sole until I read your blog! I’ve decided I should go for JR sole with a cover sole instead of Dainite. I have been to your shop near Canarby Street few years ago, I do like your buttons shoes, I think they are very smart. I don’t understand why that Zatara guy is so bittered, jealousy perhaps because he couldn’t afford owning your shoes? Please don’t delete those comments no matter how negative they are, it shows you have nothing to hide.Justin FitzPatrickThank you for commenting Mike. I do appreciate it.DarrenNever wore leather sole shoes again, after slipping up while boarding a train and nearly doing myself in.Justin FitzPatrickthat’s too badJoe K.Hey Justin, loved the blog post. I recently bought a used pair of AE Randolph Penny Loafers online and had them resoled with double JR soles and new cork etc. They’re in the same size as my Oxfords but for some reason I wore them out today and noticed that my big toe was sliding forward a bit during each step. This only happened on my left foot. I was wondering if you had any insight. It was squeaking, which leads me to believe it was sweat mixed with the smooth insole (it was summer and I was sweaty). Maybe it could also be missizing (it has a bit of heel slip) or the stiffness of the double JR soles mixed with loafers (no laces). Any advice? I just dropped about $400 in the resole so I’d hate to have to discard them.Justin FitzPatrickHello, glad that you enjoyed the post. I have a few questions. Did you try these on before resoling them? Reading this post that I just wrote yesterday might shed some light. Sounds like you needed to size down in them.https://theshoesnobblog.com/how-dress-shoes-should-fit/MattGenuinely interested in this topic and thank you for sharing insights and info. I’m approaching my 50th now and I’ve only ever had rubber sole shoes apart from one disastrous pair of leather soles that always always meant my feet for wet when ever it rained (I made the mistake of buying a fairly cheap pair of Oxford shoes at the time). Im now able to afford a higher quality shoe and I’m taking my time researching. I like the idea of breathability (based in the UK now but have spent a lot of the last 5 years in the Middle East) and – I do tend to do a lot of walking. Back to my research, I’m thinking that I want a ‘forever’ shoe now that will see me out the rest of my days. Something that will over time become almost at one with my feet – love the idea that leather sole will mound to the shape of my foot. Anyway – thanks again for the article. Don’t worry about the trolls! Cheers.Justin FitzPatrickHey Matt, thank you for comment and kind words. I get less trolls nowadays, thankfully. A double leather sole is a good one to think about for having that sleek look but comfort and durability to match. I love a good double leather sole and can walk all day in them!KookyThe pointedness of all these shoes looks like a Chinese foot binding operation. I cannot imagine the foot ailments that will be faced in old age.avarham zilbershlagThank you very much Justin for the article.Will the addition of half a rubber sole (on the original leather sole) make the sole last longer?And what do you think about Toe Taps on the heel of the shoe?(I note that I live in Israel and I still haven’t found a cobbler who deserves his title of ‘cobbler’, most of them have never heard of Goodyear Waltted, etc.)Justin FitzPatrickMy pleasureThere are many theories to your question, none that I have ever tested personally. Naturally one would think that a rubber addition helps to prolong the life of the leather sole. The naysayers say that it then doesn’t allow the sole to break and therefore the sole gets ruined from within, from all of the perspiration. Sadly, I own way too much shoes to know this first hand. But, yes, just for the sake of saving having to resole, a rubber addition will help with that and save you there.Toe taps on the heel are a no-no. Loud and slippery.', 'url': 'https://theshoesnobblog.com/leather-soles-vs-rubber-soles/', 'cleaned_text': 'There is a long debate on the differences between leather soles vs rubber soles with regard to comfort/durability/elegance etc. So I thought it wise to create a post in order to discuss all of the points and shed some light on certain myths that need debunking.\n\nI will break it up into the main topics that tend to be discussed labeling both pros and cons for each in order for you to understand better the truth behind both options\n**Comfort**\n**Leather Pro’s:** Sole leather is often thought of as this hard material that does not allow for cushion/comfort. The problem with this train of thought is that it actually doesn’t take into account that while sole leather was made to be hard, one must not forget that in reality it is still just skin and has the ability to mold and shape to your foot, allowing natural contour to take place (as it is a natural product). It therefore, combined with cork, can create a very soft and flexible footbed actually creating much more comfort than its rubber counterpart. But this is also providing that arch support is correct.\n\n**Leather Cons:** The downside of leather is that if not done properly (or in the absence of cork combined with a thin sole), it can be very rigid and not actually provide much in terms of comfort if not accompanied by proper fitting lasts/certain shoe constructions etc. A thin-soled, blake stitched, flat last (no arch support) will be one of the most uncomfortable experiences ever. On the contrary, a double leather sole, Goodyear welted shoe made on a last with proper arch support will be among the most comfortable shoes around.\n\n**Rubber Pros:** Rubber is often flexible right off the bat leaving minimal break-in period. Therefore you normally do not feel so stiff when a shoe is made on a rubber sole, even if handwelted. It also being quite sturdy makes it feel comfortable for some people. And naturally, it has more shock absorption so when you step you don’t feel the hardness of the pavement as much as you might in the leather sole.\n\n**Rubber Cons:** Rubber (whether being claimed as natural or synthetic) does not have the ability to mold to your feet like a leather sole does. So while the insole might mold to your feet, the sole does not ever mold and thus the rigidity of that lack of taking shape can often feel quite uncomfortable over time. That being, a rubber sole will often feel comfortable in the beginning of the day but if you were to be on your feet in one all day long, the non-forming rigidity of the rubber starts to make your feet grow tired.\n\n**Durability**\n**Leather Pros:** Leather’s strength lies in how many layers of leather you have on it. A triple leather sole will outlast any rubber sole. Consequently, a good double leather sole with toe taps on it would too. So the more layers of leather you have the exponentially stronger it gets.\n\n**Leather Cons:** Opposite to its pro, the less amount of layers or thinner the leather sole is the more fragile it is. I have seen guys chew through top-quality soles from the best brands there are in a matter of months due to how frequently they walked in all kinds of weather. Leather absorbs water so over time you can get it coming through your soles for the smallest of cracks or busted seams etc..\n\n**Rubber Pros:** A good rubber sole is virtually indestructible (not really but close). Due to the nature of rubber and what it is intended for, you can really go hard on it and it will last. I put so many miles on cobblestones on my Stefano Bemer chukka boots and while I rarely wear them now, am still going on the first sole after 8 years (I must have put hundreds of miles on them through the streets of Florence). Rubber is very water resistant so you really don’t have to worry about your feet getting wet, ever.\n\n**Rubber Cons:** If it cracks, it’s over. And sometimes it can crack for no apparent reason. Or if you try to dry it (i.e. leave your shoes on the heater) after being wet. I have seen what looked like good rubber soles, all of a sudden crack and then they are pretty much ruined as the cracks will only get worse.\n\n**Elegance/Formality**\n**Leather Pros:** A leather sole is the epitome of elegance and formality and is always the material of choice when making formal shoes. According to some trains of thought, the thinner and tighter the construction (think cemented or blind welt) the more elegant/formal the shoe, however, I disagree with this. I do think that the tighter the sole (i.e. not protruding out from the shape of the last) the more elegant/formal but don’t find dainty-looking thin soles to be elegant. On the contrary, if one maker made the most perfectly elegant sole it would be Gaziano & Girling or even Carmina who make a very thin-appearing goodyear welted sole that runs tight to the last shape.\n\n**Leather Con’s:** If the sole is not cut tight to the last it just looks wonky and very inelegant IMHO. So the cut has to be done right in order to maintain the correct manner of elegance and formality.\n\n**Rubber Pros:** Some snobs and/or traditionalists will say that Rubber soles cannot be elegant or formal. While I would agree about 90% there have been some makers that have sourced rubber soles that when looking at them from a side view from 5 feet away you would not be able to tell if they were rubber or leather. So that debunks the myth there as rubber can be used in an elegant setting providing that the sole maintains a manner of thinness.\n\n**Rubber Con’s:** 90% of the time rubber soles add a certain level of chunkiness to the shoe that just makes it plain informal\n**Comments**\n**Benjamin Edwards:** Why not add some pictures of well worn in leather soles?\n**Ian Isherwood:** There doesn’t seem to be any reference to history rubber (plastic really) has been around for only the last 40 years. It’s the waste that matters plastic soled shoes don’t degrade leather does. And don’t forget wooden soled leather upper clogs – brilliant you can fix them easily yourself.\n\n**Mighty Gadget:** As someone who walks a lot and lives up north I wish I could wear leather soles more often. It also makes me wonder why some work wear style boots opt for leather soles. I have put probably over 1000 miles on my Indys and apart from 3 new heels the cork sole shows barely any sign of wear.\n\n**Roger Pinnock:** The 4 season reality of life in Canada makes quality synthetic soles a far more appealing option. I don’t agree that synthetic soles look less inherently elegant – unless one adopts a circular definition which simply equates leather soles with elegance. G&G’s Wensum is currently my fave synthetic sole.\n\n**alboo:** Two of the biggest tradeoffs for me are: Rubber soles are slip resistant compared to leather which can at times be very slick. Second, rubber soles are much hotter as they don’t breathe.\n\n**zatara wood:** I’m glad I made you think about this issue. However, you’re thinking is still distorted on this issue as you are living in a bubble of delusion on the blogosphere, talking to Igent friends and factories who want to sell you product etc. Underlying all of this thinking about leather soled GW shoes is that an older technique or ‘traditional’ way of doing things is always better. In the case of leather soled goodyear welted shoes however, which by the way is relatively recent invention created for industrial production, the thinking is flawed as it churns out an impractical and worse product (at higher cost). Now there are two issues which are being conflated 1) Leather soles 2) The technique of Goodyear welting to manufacture shoes. IMO the second is actually worse in creating a heavy inflexible shoe which no one wants. Leather soles make these issues worse, whilst also having little shock absorption. However if you wear (usually Italian) blake stitched loafers with leather soles they aren’t nearly as bad. In fact some can be quite comfortable eg the classic Gucci loafer. This is because they don’t create a monocoque structure with layers of stiff material between the footbed and shoe sole. In regard to leather soles vs Rubber you are making a fatal error in not comparing like for like.

However, if you look through our website or visit a store, you will see that we offer all sorts of different sole choices in various materials, thickness, and tread – but ultimately, you are choosing between leather or rubber. So, follow me on a nerdy journey into the pros and cons of each.Leather solesLet’s start with the sole that is arguably the most divisive. Over the last few years, I believe the trusty leather sole has seen a bit of a decline in popularity, despite being the most classic out of all the sole units we offer. I would argue that people are wary of them for the same reason that they are wary of suede; they think it is fragile, and any exposure to moisture leads to it melting away (or something equally as melodramatic).Leather is a natural product, and just like the shoe’s leather upper, you can expect a leather sole to mould nicely to the shape of your foot as you wear it. Also, being porous, it actually lets your feet breathe (a strange image, I know) which can result in a more comfortable shoe, especially in the warmer months.However, in a cruel twist of fate, the leather sole’s benefits are also its hindrance. Being porous, it will let water in eventually, though I think you would have to be caught in quite a rainstorm for that to happen – at least if it’s Goodyear welted. I feel that people’s experiences with leather soles on shoes with less sturdy construction may be the reason why they shy away from them, but that’s purely speculative at this point in time.In terms of side-by-side comparisons, leather also won’t last as long as rubber before needing to be repaired. However, problems rarely arise when leather soles get wet; it’s when they are worn repeatedly without being given a chance to dry out. Proper rotation of your shoes is paramount, especially with leather soles.They are also historically the most formal, and also make a great sound when walking on hard surfaces. On the other hand, not so good for sneaking up on people.Rubber solesWe offer a veritable plethora of variations of rubber soles at Cheaney, but in essence they all offer the same properties.Firstly, they are waterproof (whilst leather is water resistant), meaning they are very well suited to our country collection and perfect for splashing about in puddles.Also, despite leather being a lot harder wearing than people make out, rubber soles will always last longer before needing to be replaced. I also find that, being man-made, they wear more consistently than leather, which can differ somewhat in wear between pairs.There is also more grip on rubber soles, though I always hesitate to use the phrase ‘non-slip’. If you’re walking on mud or snow, you’re probably going to fall on your gluteus maximus regardless of what sole you’ve got on. For day-to-day wear though, rubber soles are good for self-preservation. Anyone who has walked down wet stairs or wandered the aisles of Tesco will know that leather soles can certainly be quite scary.But let’s not start believing that rubber soles are perfect. Being a man-made composite, rubber simply does not possess the same comfort as leather because it doesn’t mould around the individual’s foot in the same way. Similarly, because it is waterproof, it cannot be breathable. Therefore in the height of summer, your feet will be noticeably hotter in rubber soled shoes.Your preference towards leather or rubber soles will depend entirely on your circumstances. If you spend most of your day in an office, consider leather soles for their comfort. If you put in lots of steps on your commute, or spend most of your day on building sites, rubber is probably a safer bet.Getting married? Leather sole. Moving to Canada?

Look at the profile! What class. Oh, leather soles, never mind”.That used to be my thinking every time I see a lovely pair of boots or shoes, only to discover that a leather sole is lurking underneath, ready to wear out — or worse, cause me to fall on my butt. It’s a common dilemma: form over function. In my mind, leather soles are classy, but they can also be impractical. If I never had to walk outdoors in my shoes, then great, I’d wear leather soles more frequently. But the problem is that I do wear my shoes outdoors.Still, I think I’ve been too harsh. There are times when leather soles can be a perfect choice, and they have more “pros” than you might have thought. In the spirit of open-mindedness, I’m going to check my assumptions at the door and take an unbiased look at leather soles.The Pros of Leather SolesLeather soles have to compete with rubber and other soles on aesthetics, utility, comfort, and durability. So how do they stack up?It’s the Dressiest SoleWe’re talking in generalities here, obviously, but a leather outsole has a low profile, which is well suited to a dressy outfit. If I’m ever wearing a suit, I prefer leather soles because they’re both old fashioned and refined, just like a good suit should be.If you’re only planning on wearing them inside, then you also get the added benefit of a nice click-clack sound on the floor.They’re Very Soft and ComfortableLeather soles are soft. Many guys will only wear shoes with leather uppers and leather outsoles for this reason — relative to a lot of tough rubber outsoles, they’re much friendlier on the knees and with regard to shock absorption. They mold around the shape of the foot over time, helping to provide a feeling of support, plus they’re very flexible and have a good ground feel.They Break In QuicklyOut-of-the-box comfort and durability are often at odds. A pair of shoes made with EVA and rubber are pretty comfy from the get go, but a pair of steel shanked hiking boots, not so much. The reason is that materials associated with comfort are lighter and lack rigidity, while more durable materials, like steel, wood, and cork, are all denser and stronger.The benefit of a pliable material like leather is that it breaks in fast. It also starts molding to your foot right away. Even cork takes a bit of time to heat up and mold to the shape of your foot.Odor ResistantThe more natural materials in a shoe, the less likely it is to smell bad. Seriously: mostly leather shoes and boots will prevent bacterial growth. The same is true for cork, and this is why a lot of guys are happy to go sockless in leather lined, leather soled shoes. (We wouldn’t, but you do you.)BreathableThis is a big one for guys down south. The reason so many cowboy boots have leather soles is, well, all of the above, but also because leather breathes better in heat than synthetics. This is also why a lot of guys prefer unlined boots, despite how much smoother feeling the interior of leather lined boots are: boots made of leather, and not too much of it, keep your feet more comfortable when it’s warm out.It might not be ideal if you live in colder climates, though; rubber is a great insulator, for better or worse.[Related: 6 Kinds of Boot Soles You Should Know About]DancingI’m the last guy I’d refer to as a dancer, but in some leather soled Alden wingtips at a recent wedding I had an epiphany: leather soles are great for dancing. Flat, clacky, and easy to swish around the floor while making contact with it, I was far lighter on my feet in leather soles. Thanks to several commenters, including the aptly named Dancing Cowgirl, for pointing this out!Leather Sole ConsWith all those pros, why would someone avoid leather soles? While the pros are many and the cons are few, the disadvantages are notable, as they affect the functionality of the shoe.They’re Not DurableA shoe’s outsole provides grip, stability, and protection from the elements. Rubber is really good at this. Leather, not so much. When you first get a leather sole it’s smooth as silk, like in the picture above. Wear it outside for ten minutes, and it’ll already look a lot like the other pictures in this article.The smoothness is a big part of why leather soles are considered dressy and classic. But they only look like that on the first wear.I should point out that some manufacturers try to counteract this. A good example is oak soles: these are not made of wood, but rather, a type of vegetable-tanned leather treated with a dye derived from oak bark, which makes the leather hardier. One of the most famous producers of this type of sole is J.R. Rendenback Soles, who provide leather outsoles for Allen Edmonds. However, they are not 100% leather, as Rendenback will often add rubber studs to their outsoles for grip.Oak soles are popular in higher end dress shoes, mainly because vegetable-tanned leather is more expensive than the more common chrome tanned leather.But in general, leather outsoles get beat up and wear through more quickly than rubber.They’re SlipperyIf you’re talking about regular leather soles (and not the kind you see above with studs in it), you’ll notice leather outsoles lack grip. If you live in a rainy or snowy climate, they are not nice to wear outside. The rubber outsole was invented primarily to make up for these shortcomings. Leather outsoles are, in many ways, an outdated technology: sole 1.0.That said, and this is important, as the sole gets beat up and scratched, those markings improve the grip to a significant degree.To avoid this, companies have found ways to combine leather and rubber.You can see Thursday’s Cavalier boot above with the studded rubber outsole. Imagine combing a Dainite studded outsole with a leather sole, and presto change-o, you have a combo rubber studded outsole.Other companies take other tactics, like the Zind boots from Helm. These use something called Fineline, a sole with a combination of rubber and leather that looks like this:They’re Not That Water ResistantOne thing about rubber soles that is often overlooked is that they are a waterproof barrier between your foot and the wet ground. Unless you’ve walked in the rain with a pair of leather-soled shoes, you’ve probably never noticed how much you rely on rubber to shield your delicate feet from the elements.This why a lot of leather-soled shoes are Butyl-Treated. Butyl is a chemical used in making rubber, so it’s sort of like taking some of the properties of a rubber sole and adding them to leather. Some people claim that butyl treatment adds stickiness to the shoe and improves grip, but how effective this is debatable. It does add water resistance and increases the durability of the shoe.But generally, leather soles suck up water and and aren’t great for wet weather.[Related: Why Is Dainite Such a Popular Boot Sole?]They Lack CushioningIn heritage boots, you often find cork in the midsole, and sometimes — as is the case with Thursday Boot Company, you’ll even find some EVA foam. These have the dual benefits of providing cushioning and allow for a comfortable fit.Leather is nice and soft and offers some cushioning, but the sole isn’t thick and it’s not synthetic. So while it’s comfortable, it doesn’t have the superior shock absorption of something like a crepe rubber sole that you’ll find on Red Wing moc toes. If you’re standing for long periods or doing high impact work, then this will be noticeable. If you’re spending the day walking around a city, though, many find the softness of leather soles advantageous.[Related: Everything you need to know about crepe soles]They’re Less StableAnother often overlooked benefit of rubber and other ridged materials is the added stability. Hiking and work boots are engineered in a way that provides a wide base, which increases stability as you move over uneven surfaces.Leather can’t be shaped in this manner, so you end up with a narrower look. This is great for formal settings when you’re trying to pull off a refined look, but not so much if you’re trying to move quickly over any type of obstacle.The TakeawayThere are a ton of different types of outsoles you can pick for your boots, but leather is the OG, the only sole that’s stood the test of time for thousands of years.It’s great if you want a sole that’s soft, that molds to the shape of your foot over time, that goes well with a suit, or will be resistant to odor. It’s not ideal for hiking or wet weather, nor is it ideal if you want to minimize resoles. It’s entirely up to you and what you prefer from your footwear; many guys are leather-or-nothing, others won’t go anywhere near it.Personally, I love to have the option of leather soles — ultimately, the best option is having more than one pair of boots![Related: My list of The Best Boots for Men]CommentsLeatherHey Karl, just a little suggestion. There is a thing called socks or footwear. if you wear it before wearing your shoes. Your life will get a little more peaceful xDNickVery good, very goodChrisReally appreciate the article sir. You did your homework and I feel I have benefited from your knowledge / research.Thank you!NickHey thanks a lot Chris! Glad you liked itVipul GoelExcellent article! Very informative. Seriously thinking of buying a leather-soled pair of shoes!NickSo glad this very niche article appealed to someone, Vipul!DaveGreat article, but you fail to mention the single-most important PRO of leather soles. The ability to keep your body grounded to the Earth’s surface, thereby allowing electrons (the best antioxidants known to man) to flow freely through your body and reduce or even eliminate inflammation.Nick EnglishI did not forget to say thatC-manDave is on the good sh*t. lol.CowboyForgot that leather “slippery shoes” are best for dancing. Rubber soles do not slide, and you want them to slide. So it depends on the purpose you buy them for.Nick EnglishAgree, and leather soles breathe well too! Great when you’re exertingDancing CowgirlThis was my thought as well. Leather soles are not outdated technology….he left out the purpose of dancing completely.Nick EnglishGotta add that in, thanks for the reminder!Ben LLove your content! Can you please share about methods/products that help make leather soles less slippery?Nick EnglishBeyond just wearing them and beating them up, any cobbler can attach some rubber to the bottom if it’s an issue. You sacrifice the breathability though!Regenia GodfreyCowboy boots! Key to a safe boot is the ability of your boot to slip out of the stirrups if you fall off a horse!!!! My friend was wearing rubber type soled boot and when he fell off his horse his boot didn’t slide out. Yep his foot was ripped off. He lost his foot!!!Nick EnglishAhhhh! Good to know there’s practicality to the laceless styleBrentDo you have any advice for care of leather soles? Conditioners or waterproofing products to help extend the life of the soles? I bought a used pair of boots and I want to do everything I can to maximize my investment. TIANick EnglishGood question! I think regular Venetian Shoe Cream now and then should be fine.MartinI love the look of leather soles. However, they have one huge drawback for me: the hard heel. When I take a step in them, the impact of the heel onto the surface sends a jarring impact to my spine, which makes them, well, unwearable. They are bad for my spine and hips, because of that jarring impact from the heel.Nick EnglishOh that’s interesting, a fair few leather soled boots have rubber taps on the heel to remedy that issue without affecting breathability too much. Also, insoles can help too, though that would also hit the breathability. not that most people notice the breathability anyway!', 'url': 'https://stridewise.com/pros-cons-leather-soles/', 'cleaned_text': 'Ah, the old leather sole conundrum. That used to be my thinking every time I see a lovely pair of boots or shoes, only to discover that a leather sole is lurking underneath, ready to wear out — or worse, cause me to fall on my butt. It’s a common dilemma: form over function. In my mind, leather soles are classy, but they can also be impractical. If I never had to walk outdoors in my shoes, then great, I’d wear leather soles more frequently. But the problem is that I do wear my shoes outdoors.\n\nStill, I think I’ve been too harsh. There are times when leather soles can be a perfect choice, and they have more “pros” than you might have thought. In the spirit of open-mindedness, I’m going to check my assumptions at the door and take an unbiased look at leather soles.\n\nThe Pros of Leather Soles\nLeather soles have to compete with rubber and other soles on aesthetics, utility, comfort, and durability. So how do they stack up?\n\nIt’s the Dressiest Sole\nWe’re talking in generalities here, obviously, but a leather outsole has a low profile, which is well suited to a dressy outfit. If I’m ever wearing a suit, I prefer leather soles because they’re both old fashioned and refined, just like a good suit should be. If you’re only planning on wearing them inside, then you also get the added benefit of a nice click-clack sound on the floor.\n\nThey’re Very Soft and Comfortable\nLeather soles are soft. Many guys will only wear shoes with leather uppers and leather outsoles for this reason — relative to a lot of tough rubber outsoles, they’re much friendlier on the knees and with regard to shock absorption. They mold around the shape of the foot over time, helping to provide a feeling of support, plus they’re very flexible and have a good ground feel.\n\nThey Break In Quickly\nOut-of-the-box comfort and durability are often at odds. A pair of shoes made with EVA and rubber are pretty comfy from the get go, but a pair of steel shanked hiking boots, not so much. The reason is that materials associated with comfort are lighter and lack rigidity, while more durable materials, like steel, wood, and cork, are all denser and stronger. The benefit of a pliable material like leather is that it breaks in fast. It also starts molding to your foot right away. Even cork takes a bit of time to heat up and mold to the shape of your foot.\n\nOdor Resistant\nThe more natural materials in a shoe, the less likely it is to smell bad. Seriously: mostly leather shoes and boots will prevent bacterial growth. The same is true for cork, and this is why a lot of guys are happy to go sockless in leather lined, leather soled shoes. (We wouldn’t, but you do you.)\n\nBreathable\nThis is a big one for guys down south. The reason so many cowboy boots have leather soles is, well, all of the above, but also because leather breathes better in heat than synthetics.

With this construction, you can keep the upper for an extended period of time and only change the sole when worn down. The benefit of using the same upper is that it will adapt to your feet over time and give you a personal fit.Attentive shoe buyers and connoisseurs might already have dealt with the nature of their shoe sole.

Leather, a natural material, is highly valued for its exceptional breathability, which allows for air circulation, significantly reducing moisture buildup and mitigating the risk of common fungal infections like athlete's foot. Furthermore, leather's unique property of molding to the wearer's foot over time provides a custom fit, enhancing comfort and support. ""Leather is often recommended by podiatrists for its breathability and ability to conform to the foot, which can reduce pressure points and improve overall comfort,"" notes Dr. Emily Splichal, a podiatrist and human movement specialist.

In contrast, rubber soles are renowned for their superior shock absorption and excellent grip, making them a preferred choice for activities requiring cushioning and stability on diverse surfaces. This inherent cushioning can substantially lessen the impact on joints, proving beneficial for individuals engaged in high-impact activities or those with joint sensitivities. However, rubber's less porous nature means it offers reduced breathability compared to leather, potentially trapping heat and moisture, which may lead to odor and a less hygienic foot environment if not properly ventilated.

The profound impact of footwear choices on overall foot well-being is undeniable. A 2022 study published in the *Journal of Foot and Ankle Research* indicated that approximately 77% of adults experience foot pain, with footwear being a significant contributing factor. Therefore, making informed decisions about shoe materials based on activity levels and individual foot needs is crucial for maintaining long-term foot health. For further guidance on selecting appropriate footwear, the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) provides comprehensive resources and recommendations [https://www.apma.org/].",success
