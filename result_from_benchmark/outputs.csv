Recently, this strict view has come under review. With the arrival of new methods of genome editing, especially CRISPR/Cas 9, new perspectives on germline interventions have arisen. In their report Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance, the American National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine have stated that clinical research using germline genome editing (GGE) in humans should be permitted (The National Academies 2017). In the long run, this may lead to the development of clinical applications. The Academies propose to limit GGE to severe cases of disease and disability where no alternative treatment is possible. It follows that although there are certain contexts where GGE could be used in a beneficial way, it should be used within narrow limits and with caution. GGE is mainly discussed in the context of disease prevention and infertility treatment (Ishii 2017a, b; Long et al. 2014). Disease prevention is widely seen as a benefit that outweighs severe risks connected to GGE. Some even claim the preventative use of GGE to be a moral imperative; its application is an obligation for the sake of patients and future generations (Gyngell et al. 2017). In addition, GGE provides new perspectives for infertility patients who have no other option to create offspring that are genetically related to them. But there are also those who state that the medical as well as societal risks are too high, and argue, accordingly, for a full ban (Lanphier et al. 2015). Although there are no clinical applications of GGE available at the moment, it is important to have an intense ethical debate at this early stage in order to be prepared for coming developments, given the speed at which research efforts are now being conducted. A future clinical implementation of GGE needs an ethical framing which provides guidelines for clinicians.The aim of our paper is to analyze the ethical implications of editing the human germline by using new procedures of genome editing. Editing somatic cells as an application of gene editing technology, and its ethical implications, is not the focus of our analysis. We discuss GGE as a possible clinical application, not as a research technique. Specifically, we attempt to provide an analysis of the risks and benefits that could arise from such an application. Weighing the risks and benefits of new technologies is important, but it is only one aspect of assessing technologies. We do not claim that our analysis is exhaustive or final; broader ethical analysis still needs to be done in order to thoroughly evaluate GGE. Although we focus on risks and benefits, many other aspects need to be taken into consideration, e.g. questions of reproductive autonomy or access to the procedure. Furthermore, questions of research ethics arise, as well as questions concerning regulations of the translational process. We addressed some of these questions elsewhere (Rubeis and Steger 2016). In this paper, we seek to produce a sound ethical evaluation of GGE in terms of its potential risks and benefits. The focus of our analysis is on this question: whether the benefits of GGE really outweigh the risks that are usually ascribed to a germline intervention? Apart from medical risks on the individual level like off-target mutations and genetic mosaicism, and medical risks on the population level, there are also societal risks like genetic enhancement. That means that the nature, aim, and risks of the possible applications have to be clarified. It has to be clear who benefits from the method and whether this benefit justifies the risks of its application.Possible applications of GGEIn August 2017, the first therapeutic germline intervention using CRISPR/Cas9 was reported (Ma et al. 2017). A team from Oregon Health & Science University created zygotes by fertilizing healthy oocytes with sperm cells from a carrier of the MYBPC3 mutation. This mutation leads to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heritable heart condition. By using CRISPR/Cas9, the team then corrected the genetic defect in the zygotes which led to the development of viable embryos. The majority of these embryos was mutation-free. Since the intervention in the germline did occur for research purposes, the embryos were not implanted in utero. This research shows that correcting a gene mutation in viable human embryos using genome editing methods is feasible. It confirms results from earlier research on human embryos by two Chinese research groups in 2015 and 2016 (Kang et al. 2016; Liang et al. 2015) and a team at the Francis-Crick-Institute in London (Callaway 2016).There are various different applications of genome editing in germline therapy, especially by using CRISPR-based methods (Ishii 2017a, b). All elements of the germline, oocytes, sperm cells, and embryos, can be edited. One possibility is the editing of oocytes. The method could be used to correct the mutation in the TUBB8-gene which is known to cause developmental arrest after fertilization. The method can be applied to the oocyte after retrieval. The edited and verified oocyte could then be used for an IVF. Furthermore, sperm cells can be edited through spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) editing. This procedure could be used for treating genetic infertility. By conducting a testicular biopsy, the SSCs can be retrieved and transfected with programmable nucleases. After genetic analysis and verification, the SSCs can be transferred back into the donor’s testes. The edited SSCs then trigger the production of mutation-free sperm cells. In order to ensure reproductive success, the resulting sperm cells could be used for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Apart from sperm cells and oocytes, genome editing can be applied to zygotes, i.e. fertilized oocytes. This could be a therapeutic option for several monogenetic diseases such as Huntington’s disease or β-thalassemia. After fertilization through IVF or ICSI, the zygote can be microinjected with programmable nucleases. The resulting embryo could be tested by using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to ensure that there are no off-target-effects. For the PGD, a blastomere biopsy three days post-fertilization or a trophectoderm biopsy four to five days post-fertilization could be used. After testing and verification, the embryo can be transferred in utero.There are two possible applications discussed at the moment. The first possible application is infertility treatment. Oocyte editing and spermatogonial editing could be an option for patients suffering from genetic infertility. The second possible application is disease prevention. Also in this context, the editing of oocytes or sperm cells could be a possible application. Additionally, the editing of zygotes may be a way of correcting genetic errors that are likely to cause health problems later on.The first studies using GGE on human embryos showed that there are severe medical risks (Liang et al. 2015; Kang et al. 2016). These risks are mainly due to off-target effects. Off-target effects occur when DNA double strand breaks are made at the wrong target site. The result is an inaccurate or incomplete editing, causing improper translocations, inversions or large deletions which can lead to point mutations (Ishii 2017b). The latest research shows that off-target effects in human embryos, although still existing, can be minimized (Ma et al. 2017). Also, the occurrence of genetic mosaicism could be diminished to a minimum. Genetic mosaicism is the coexistence of edited cells and wild types, a condition that may lead to severe health conditions (Ishii 2017b). Due to the multifactorial nature of the processes involved, the exact consequences of genetic mosaicism are hard to predict. However, clinical research is only now beginning. A lot of translational research is needed before GGE can be implemented in clinical practice. Although the latest results mean an enormous step forward, there is still a long way to go before these methods are safe enough for clinical application. Apart from the risks for the embryo and future child that is directly affected by GGE, there is another level of risks to consider. Genetic modifications of the human germ-line will be passed on to coming generations. This means that an off-target effect does not only affect one individual, but possibly many future individuals. How exactly off-target effects and genetic mosaicism would manifest in future generations, is almost impossible to predict which makes this risk incalculable. Therefore, a proper risk-assessment has to include coming generations as well.Risks and benefits of GGEAt the moment, the empirical evidence shows that any clinical application would be too unsafe (Ishii 2017b; Ma et al. 2017). However, with research efforts speeding up, clinical applications might be safe enough in the near future. Ethical evaluation of further implementation of these initiatives, as well as safety concerns in individual cases, is needed. One of these concerns is the effect of GGE on the population level (The National Academies 2017). Since germ cells are altered, the modified genes could be passed on to future generations (Ormond et al. 2017). Thus, the modified genes could spread within the human gene pool with yet unforeseeable consequences. For example, the genetic trait for sickle-cell anaemia also protects its carrier against malaria. Similarly, there may be as yet unknown positive effects to genes ordinarily considered pathogenic. On the other hand, modified genes which appear not to affect its carrier may turn out to be pathogenic over time. This aggravates safety concerns, since not only one individual, but many individuals or whole populations might be affected by possible pathogenic effects of the modified genes. Due to the complexity of gene frequency and microevolution, it is impossible to manage or even predict the impact of modified genes in future generations.Another topic in the discussion is the specific way in which the human genome is altered through GGE. Some state that GGE implies a new level of interfering with nature that is to be considered as irresponsible. Therefore, the procedure crosses a line that should not be crossed (Lanphier et al. 2015). Others claim that the risk of misuse is too high (Baltimore et al. 2015, Hildt 2016). Apart from disease prevention or infertility treatment, GGE could be used without any medical indication for enhancement purposes. Genetic enhancement is seen by many as societal risk because it could lead to the creation of two classes of humans, the enhanced and the non-enhanced. This would challenge the very ideas of justice and equality which are crucial to modern society. But there are also those that consider the implementation of GGE as ethically justified. Supporters of GGE see benefits of the method in two areas, disease prevention and infertility treatment (Gyngell et al. 2017; Savulescu et al. 2015).As we have seen, GGE could be used in order to prevent hereditary monogenic disease like Huntington’s or β-thalassemia. As in the case of the carrier of the MYBPC3 mutation mentioned above, GGE would allow individuals with certain hereditary diseases to reproduce without passing on the disease. This would mean an immense benefit for individuals with a known genetic risk who want to have children. They could fulfil their wish to have children without the risk of severe health conditions or ailments. So far, couples with genetic risk depend on embryo selection, gamete donation, or adoption. Embryo selection, mostly through PGD, can be applied in certain cases to ensure that a certain genetic trait is not passed on. The method is elaborate, costly and often stressful for patients. It also implies the discarding of embryos with unwanted traits which is ethically questionable. Also, there are cases of dominant late-onset conditions like Huntington’s where a selection of embryos by using PGD is not possible. Thus, GGE could be used to prevent offspring from inheriting pathogenic genes.Apart from disease prevention, GGE is also presented as a potential infertility treatment. One possible application is non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in male patients (Vij et al. 2018). For female patients with a ’missense mutation’ in the TUBB8 in oocytes, GGE could also be an option (Ishii 2017b). So far, the only option for these patients to create offspring is through gamete donation. When it comes to gamete donation, legal restraints have to be considered apart from the effort and ethical implications. Since gamete donation is legally prohibited in many countries, the treatment is not always available. It furthermore implies that that the resulting child is not genetically related to both of the partners that apply the method. The fact that the genetic material of another individual is used conflicts with the wish for a child that is genetically related to both partners. Also, when it comes to adoption, this issue is to be considered. The wish for a child implies a child that is genetically related to both partners for most couples. Genetic relatedness, however, cannot be provided by adoption. GGE could be a viable alternative to PGD, gamete donation, and adoption. It circumvents the ethical and legal implications of these options by making a healthy genetically-related child a possibility for potential parents. As Gyngell et al. (2017) claim, for some reproduction partners GGE would be the only option to create offspring that is genetically related to both. It is, however, contestable that genetic relatedness is a strong argument for allowing genetic modifications (Baylis 2013).Following the supporters of GGE, editing the germline would also provide benefits on a population level (Powell 2015). Correcting a pathogenic genetic mutation in the germ cells of an individual patient means that the genetic errors disappear from the germline. Thus, the mutation is prevented from spreading within the gene pool of a given population. Disease prevention would benefit future generations, in addition to the individual affected by the application of GGE. This public health benefit has led to the call for a genome-wise program of GGE (Powell 2015). And this argument suggests that we are morally obliged to improve health outcomes for future generations. In addition, the implementation of a large-scale program would lead to an eventual decrease in healthcare costs. Taken in its totality, supporters of GGE claim that in the light of its public health benefits, this pursuit should be regarded as a moral imperative (Gyngell et al. 2017).In order to decide whether the expected benefits of GGE outweigh the risks, we have to analyze the arguments brought forward by opponents and supporters of the method. The argument that implementing GGE means interfering with nature and therefore crossing a line that should not be crossed is not well-founded, since modern medicine implies interfering with nature on many levels already. As long as security standards are followed, there is no reason why interfering with nature for medical purposes should be prohibited in this specific context when it is accepted and well-established in others. Apart from medical risks, which clearly have to be diminished through further research, opponents of GGE also identify societal risks. The main societal risk is seen in the possible misuse of GGE for non-medically indicated purposes such as genetic enhancement. There is an ongoing debate whether genetic enhancement is ethically acceptable. This an issue that surely needs a focused analysis that cannot be given here. Apart from the question, whether we should accept genetic enhancement as such, there is the argument that neither our societies nor our legal frameworks are prepared for its impact (Lanphier et al. 2015). However, we are already taking precautions against the enhancing use of reproductive technologies. When it comes to PGD for example, there are legal restrictions in place in most countries that prohibit any non-medically indicated use. An analogous legal framework for GGE could be created. This can be considered as a practical argument following which the possibility of genetic enhancement is not a strong argument against GGE because it can be regulated when needed. Rules and regulations could be implemented in order to guarantee that GGE is only used in medically indicated cases. The differences between the cases do not only result from the nature of the procedure applied, but also from the moral status of the agent involved. Whether a medical intervention is to be considered as treatment or enhancement depends on the specific circumstances of the case. Each case where GGE is applied would have to be evaluated by an ethics committee, since there is no overall criterion to separate treatment from enhancement. This would have to be a case-to-case decision. Thus, the argument following which the risk of misuse of GGE is too high has to be considered as non-convincing.When considering the arguments in favor of GGE, we find that main benefit of GGE is seen in disease prevention for monogenic diseases (Gyngell et al. 2017; Powell 2015; Savulescu and Gyngell 2015). The argument implies that by using GGE, a future individual can be prevented from having a monogenic disease. This notion is valid with some restrictions. It is unproblematic as long as we deal with editing sperm cells or oocyte. In these cases, the pathogenic genes are eliminated or modified, so that they will not be transferred to the future individual. Thus, the future individual is prevented from inheriting the genetic defect. The matter is more complex, however, when we deal with zygotes. The edited zygote is only created because of the availability of GGE. The fact that GGE is available is the only reason a couple with pathogenic traits decides to create a zygote that is then immediately edited, thus producing an embryo without the pathogenic genetic trait. In other words, a zygote with a genetic defect is knowingly created in order to be edited at once. By stretching the boundaries of the term, this therapeutic procedure may also have the effect of disease prevention, particularly at the population level. The challenge here is the status of the zygote. If one considers the zygote as an individual, the term therapy may apply. If one considers the zygote as eukaryotic, diploid cell, it is unproblematic to call GGE disease prevention, since, analogous to sperm cell and oocyte-editing, a future individual is prevented from inheriting a monogenic disease. Given this definition, the term therapy would be misleading. The term therapy could only be used if an in vivo application of GGE was possible. Imagine the case where a life-threatening genetic defect is detected in an embryo in the womb by using prenatal genetic diagnosis. If GGE was applied here, given the technical feasibility which is unavailable at the moment, then we would deal with a life-saving therapy. Another possibility would be to classify GGE as an elaborate procedure of ART which is to fulfil one’s wish to have a child. Both reproduction partners know about their genetic conditions. They know that if they reproduce, their offspring could inherit a pathogenic trait. Instead of using alternatives like gamete donation or adoption, they decide to create a zygote with the pathogenic trait that is altered afterwards. That means that there was no immediate need for intervening in the genome in the first place. These terminological issues may seem purely academic, but they may shape the development of clinical practice. Given a publicly funded healthcare system, it is to be expected that the question, whether or not GGE should be covered by the public health scheme, will arise. Usually, methods of disease prevention and therapeutic measures are covered by the public health scheme, whereas not all procedures of ART are financed by the public. In this regard, it may become important to clarify the status of GGE.As noted, GGE could also be used as a means of disease prevention on a population level. However, it is doubtful how a large-scale use of GGE should be implemented without coercive measures. In order to be thoroughly effective, GGE may have to be mandatory for all carriers of certain genetic traits who want to reproduce. That such a coercive, if not eugenic, measure would be implemented seems rather unlikely. Therefore, disease prevention on a population level may at most be considered as a side effect of GGE.Do the benefits outweigh the risks?It follows from our analysis that we can identify three types of risks: Firstly, there is a medical risk for the child that is created through GGE. Off-target effects and mosaicism are the crucial risk factors here. These risks are still prevalent despite recent refinement of GGE procedures. We are usually willing to take certain risks when a new method can be used to treat or prevent diseases that have so far been untreatable. As we have seen, the National Academies in the United States have suggested translational research on GGE which aims at a preventive use in cases of severe disease or disability where no alternative methods exist (The National Academies 2017). If we consider GGE as a possible means of disease prevention (notwithstanding the terminological difficulties outlined above), there are certain cases that fulfill these conditions, i.e. monogenic diseases like Huntington’s. Since these conditions are usually severe and since there are no treatment alternatives, translational research efforts are justified. The same holds for infertility treatment. GGE is a promising method that allows couples with a known genetic risk to create healthy offspring that is genetically related to both partners. It can be used as an infertility treatment in cases where a genetic defect leads to infertile oocytes or sperm cells. As an assisted reproduction technology, GGE is certainly an alternative to available methods. It renders gamete donation obsolete and allows infertile partners to have a child that is genetically related to both of them. Regarding both disease prevention and infertility treatment, the main goal of the translational research will have to be the reduction of off-target effects and genetic mosaicism. However, it will be difficult to decide when an acceptable level of risk is reached. Whether the benefits outweigh the risks in this regard, however, depends on the outcome of future translational research.Secondly, there is a medical risk for future generations. Since interventions in the germline mean that the modified genetic trait is passed on, errors in editing may have negative effects on future individuals. It is extremely difficult to predict which consequences genetic mosaicism for example will generate in one individual. It is even harder, if not impossible to foresee the effects in two or three generations. It is doubtful, whether further research will be useful here since effects on whole populations and in future generations are very difficult, if not impossible to model. However, if we consider that only a few individuals will use GGE, the risks at the level of the population must be put into perspective. The number of GGE-treatments might be small enough as to have no effect on the genome of a whole population (The National Academies 2017).Thirdly, there are societal risks. GGE could be used for non-medically indicated purposes, first and foremost genetic enhancement. The majority considers genetic enhancement as a societal hazard because it may compromise social justice and equality. However, this slippery-slope-argument suggests that the non-medically indicated use of GGE is a necessary consequence of its clinical implementation. This does not have to be the case since it is possible to create guidelines and regulations before GGE is implemented. This implies an intense ethical, legal, and public debate. Since the societal risks are manageable, they do not outweigh the benefits.ConclusionGGE offers promising possibilities for disease prevention and infertility treatment. The technique has been improved immensely in recent years and its medical risks have diminished. GGE might therefore be safe enough to be implemented in the clinic in the near future. Societal risk can easily be managed by implementing a regulative framework that limits GGE to medically-indicated uses. However, the effects of modified genes within the gene pool of a given population are unforeseeable and uncontrollable. It is almost impossible to predict which impact these modifications will have in future generations. When it comes to weighing risks and benefits, the question of scale is an important point. Given the treatment of one individual, we have sufficient data to assess the risks, e.g. for off-target mutations. This assessment becomes more difficult on a societal level, but is still possible, as long as a broad public debate takes place. But it is hard to see how such an assessment should be possible when the data simply cannot be retrieved sufficiently. Since the number of cases where GGE is applied will be small, there might not be an effect at all, but it is hard to say at the moment. Maybe future research will provide the means of calculating the effects of modified genes on a population level sufficiently. As long as this is not the case, the wish of few individuals to have a genetically related child does not outweigh the risks for a whole population.Contributor InformationGiovanni Rubeis, Email: ed.mlu-inu@siebur.innavoig.Florian Steger, Email: ed.mlu-inu@regets.nairolf.References- Baltimore D, Berg P, Botchan M, Carroll D, Charo RA, Church G, Corn JE, Daley GQ, Doudna JA, Fenner M, Greely HT, Jinek M, Martin GS, Penhoet E, Puck J, Stemberg SH, Weissman JS, Yamamoto KR.

Recently, this strict view has come under review. With the arrival of new methods of genome editing, especially CRISPR/Cas 9, new perspectives on germline interventions have arisen. In their report Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance, the American National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine have stated that clinical research using germline genome editing (GGE) in humans should be permitted (The National Academies 2017). In the long run, this may lead to the development of clinical applications. The Academies propose to limit GGE to severe cases of disease and disability where no alternative treatment is possible. It follows that although there are certain contexts where GGE could be used in a beneficial way, it should be used within narrow limits and with caution. GGE is mainly discussed in the context of disease prevention and infertility treatment (Ishii 2017a, b; Long et al. 2014). Disease prevention is widely seen as a benefit that outweighs severe risks connected to GGE. Some even claim the preventative use of GGE to be a moral imperative; its application is an obligation for the sake of patients and future generations (Gyngell et al. 2017). In addition, GGE provides new perspectives for infertility patients who have no other option to create offspring that are genetically related to them. But there are also those who state that the medical as well as societal risks are too high, and argue, accordingly, for a full ban (Lanphier et al. 2015). Although there are no clinical applications of GGE available at the moment, it is important to have an intense ethical debate at this early stage in order to be prepared for coming developments, given the speed at which research efforts are now being conducted. A future clinical implementation of GGE needs an ethical framing which provides guidelines for clinicians.\n\nThe aim of our paper is to analyze the ethical implications of editing the human germline by using new procedures of genome editing. Editing somatic cells as an application of gene editing technology, and its ethical implications, is not the focus of our analysis. We discuss GGE as a possible clinical application, not as a research technique. Specifically, we attempt to provide an analysis of the risks and benefits that could arise from such an application. Weighing the risks and benefits of new technologies is important, but it is only one aspect of assessing technologies. We do not claim that our analysis is exhaustive or final; broader ethical analysis still needs to be done in order to thoroughly evaluate GGE. Although we focus on risks and benefits, many other aspects need to be taken into consideration, e.g. questions of reproductive autonomy or access to the procedure. Furthermore, questions of research ethics arise, as well as questions concerning regulations of the translational process. We addressed some of these questions elsewhere (Rubeis and Steger 2016). In this paper, we seek to produce a sound ethical evaluation of GGE in terms of its potential risks and benefits. The focus of our analysis is on this question: whether the benefits of GGE really outweigh the risks that are usually ascribed to a germline intervention? Apart from medical risks on the individual level like off-target mutations and genetic mosaicism, and medical risks on the population level, there are also societal risks like genetic enhancement. That means that the nature, aim, and risks of the possible applications have to be clarified. It has to be clear who benefits from the method and whether this benefit justifies the risks of its application.\n\nPossible applications of GGE\nIn August 2017, the first therapeutic germline intervention using CRISPR/Cas9 was reported (Ma et al. 2017). A team from Oregon Health & Science University created zygotes by fertilizing healthy oocytes with sperm cells from a carrier of the MYBPC3 mutation. This mutation leads to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heritable heart condition. By using CRISPR/Cas9, the team then corrected the genetic defect in the zygotes which led to the development of viable embryos. The majority of these embryos was mutation-free. Since the intervention in the germline did occur for research purposes, the embryos were not implanted in utero. This research shows that correcting a gene mutation in viable human embryos using genome editing methods is feasible. It confirms results from earlier research on human embryos by two Chinese research groups in 2015 and 2016 (Kang et al. 2016; Liang et al. 2015) and a team at the Francis-Crick-Institute in London (Callaway 2016).\n\nThere are various different applications of genome editing in germline therapy, especially by using CRISPR-based methods (Ishii 2017a, b). All elements of the germline, oocytes, sperm cells, and embryos, can be edited. One possibility is the editing of oocytes. The method could be used to correct the mutation in the TUBB8-gene which is known to cause developmental arrest after fertilization. The method can be applied to the oocyte after retrieval. The edited and verified oocyte could then be used for an IVF. Furthermore, sperm cells can be edited through spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) editing. This procedure could be used for treating genetic infertility. By conducting a testicular biopsy, the SSCs can be retrieved and transfected with programmable nucleases. After genetic analysis and verification, the SSCs can be transferred back into the donor’s testes. The edited SSCs then trigger the production of mutation-free sperm cells. In order to ensure reproductive success, the resulting sperm cells could be used for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Apart from sperm cells and oocytes, genome editing can be applied to zygotes, i.e. fertilized oocytes. This could be a therapeutic option for several monogenetic diseases such as Huntington’s disease or β-thalassemia. After fertilization through IVF or ICSI, the zygote can be microinjected with programmable nucleases. The resulting embryo could be tested by using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to ensure that there are no off-target-effects. For the PGD, a blastomere biopsy three days post-fertilization or a trophectoderm biopsy four to five days post-fertilization could be used. After testing and verification, the embryo can be transferred in utero.\n\nThere are two possible applications discussed at the moment. The first possible application is infertility treatment. Oocyte editing and spermatogonial editing could be an option for patients suffering from genetic infertility. The second possible application is disease prevention. Also in this context, the editing of oocytes or sperm cells\n\n'}, {'raw_text': '12.4: Genetic Engineering - Risks, Benefits, and Perceptions- Page ID- 5191Learning Objectives- Summarize the mechanisms, risks, and potential benefits of gene therapy- Identify ethical issues involving gene therapy and the regulatory agencies that provide oversight for clinical trials- Compare somatic-cell and germ-line gene therapyMany types of genetic engineering have yielded clear benefits with few apparent risks. Few would question, for example, the value of our now abundant supply of human insulin produced by genetically engineered bacteria. However, many emerging applications of genetic engineering are much more controversial, often because their potential benefits are pitted against significant risks, real or perceived. This is certainly the case for gene therapy, a clinical application of genetic engineering that may one day provide a cure for many diseases but is still largely an experimental approach to treatment.Mechanisms and Risks of Gene TherapyHuman diseases that result from genetic mutations are often difficult to treat with drugs or other traditional forms of therapy because the signs and symptoms of disease result from abnormalities in a patient’s genome. For example, a patient may have a genetic mutation that prevents the expression of a specific protein required for the normal function of a particular cell type. This is the case in patients with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), a genetic disease that impairs the function of certain white blood cells essential to the immune system.Gene therapy attempts to correct genetic abnormalities by introducing a nonmutated, functional gene into the patient’s genome. The nonmutated gene encodes a functional protein that the patient would otherwise be unable to produce. Viral vectors such as adenovirus are sometimes used to introduce the functional gene; part of the viral genome is removed and replaced with the desired gene (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)). More advanced forms of gene therapy attempt to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case with treatment of SCID.So far, gene therapies have proven relatively ineffective, with the possible exceptions of treatments for cystic fibrosisand adenosine deaminase deficiency, a type of SCID. Other trials have shown the clear hazards of attempting genetic manipulation in complex multicellular organisms like humans. In some patients, the use of an adenovirus vector can trigger an unanticipated inflammatory response from the immune system, which may lead to organ failure. Moreover, because viruses can often target multiple cell types, the virus vector may infect cells not targeted for the therapy, damaging these other cells and possibly leading to illnesses such as cancer. Another potential risk is that the modified virus could revert to being infectious and cause disease in the patient. Lastly, there is a risk that the inserted gene could unintentionally inactivate another important gene in the patient’s genome, disrupting normal cell cycling and possibly leading to tumor formation and cancer. Because gene therapy involves so many risks, candidates for gene therapy need to be fully informed of these risks before providing informed consent to undergo the therapy.The risks of gene therapy were realized in the 1999 case of Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old patient who received gene therapy as part of a clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania. Jesse received gene therapy for a condition called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, which leads to ammonia accumulation in the blood due to deficient ammonia processing. Four days after the treatment, Jesse died after a massive immune response to the adenovirus vector.1Until that point, researchers had not really considered an immune response to the vector to be a legitimate risk, but on investigation, it appears that the researchers had some evidence suggesting that this was a possible outcome. Prior to Jesse’s treatment, several other human patients had suffered side effects of the treatment, and three monkeys used in a trial had died as a result of inflammation and clotting disorders. Despite this information, it appears that neither Jesse nor his family were made aware of these outcomes when they consented to the therapy. Jesse’s death was the first patient death due to a gene therapy treatment and resulted in the immediate halting of the clinical trial in which he was involved, the subsequent halting of all other gene therapy trials at the University of Pennsylvania, and the investigation of all other gene therapy trials in the United States. As a result, the regulation and oversight of gene therapy overall was reexamined, resulting in new regulatory protocols that are still in place today.Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)- Explain how gene therapy works in theory.- Identify some risks of gene therapy.Oversight of Gene TherapyPresently, there is significant oversight of gene therapy clinical trials. At the federal level, three agencies regulate gene therapy in parallel: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP), and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Along with several local agencies, these federal agencies interact with the institutional review board to ensure that protocols are in place to protect patient safety during clinical trials. Compliance with these protocols is enforced mostly on the local level in cooperation with the federal agencies. Gene therapies are currently under the most extensive federal and local review compared to other types of therapies, which are more typically only under the review of the FDA. Some researchers believe that these extensive regulations actually inhibit progress in gene therapy research. In 2013, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) called upon the NIH to relax its review of gene therapy trials in most cases.2 However, ensuring patient safety continues to be of utmost concern.Ethical ConcernsBeyond the health risks of gene therapy, the ability to genetically modify humans poses a number of ethical issues related to the limits of such “therapy.” While current research is focused on gene therapy for genetic diseases, scientists might one day apply these methods to manipulate other genetic traits not perceived as desirable. This raises questions such as:Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)- Which genetic traits are worthy of being “corrected”?- Should gene therapy be used for cosmetic reasons or to enhance human abilities?- Should genetic manipulation be used to impart desirable traits to the unborn?- Is everyone entitled to gene therapy, or could the cost of gene therapy create new forms of social inequality?- Who should be responsible for regulating and policing inappropriate use of gene therapies?The ability to alter reproductive cells using gene therapy could also generate new ethical dilemmas. To date, the various types of gene therapies have been targeted to somatic cells, the non-reproductive cells within the body. Because somatic cell traits are not inherited, any genetic changes accomplished by somatic-cell gene therapy would not be passed on to offspring. However, should scientists successfully introduce new genes to germ cells (eggs or sperm), the resulting traits could be passed on to offspring. This approach, called germ-line gene therapy, could potentially be used to combat heritable diseases, but it could also lead to unintended consequences for future generations. Moreover, there is the question of informed consent, because those impacted by germ-line gene therapy are unborn and therefore unable to choose whether they receive the therapy. For these reasons, the U.S. government does not currently fund research projects investigating germ-line gene therapies in humans.Risky Gene TherapiesWhile there are currently no gene therapies on the market in the United States, many are in the pipeline and it is likely that some will eventually be approved. With recent advances in gene therapies targeting p53, a gene whose somatic cell mutations have been implicated in over 50% of human cancers,3 cancer treatments through gene therapies could become much more widespread once they reach the commercial market.Bringing any new therapy to market poses ethical questions that pit the expected benefits against the risks. How quickly should new therapies be brought to the market? How can we ensure that new therapies have been sufficiently tested for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed to the public? The process by which new therapies are developed and approved complicates such questions, as those involved in the approval process are often under significant pressure to get a new therapy approved even in the face of significant risks.To receive FDA approval for a new therapy, researchers must collect significant laboratory data from animal trials and submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Following a 30-day waiting period during which the FDA reviews the IND, clinical trials involving human subjects may begin. If the FDA perceives a problem prior to or during the clinical trial, the FDA can order a “clinical hold” until any problems are addressed. During clinical trials, researchers collect and analyze data on the therapy’s effectiveness and safety, including any side effects observed. Once the therapy meets FDA standards for effectiveness and safety, the developers can submit a New Drug Application (NDA) that details how the therapy will be manufactured, packaged, monitored, and administered.Because new gene therapies are frequently the result of many years (even decades) of laboratory and clinical research, they require a significant financial investment. By the time a therapy has reached the clinical trials stage, the financial stakes are high for pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders. This creates potential conflicts of interest that can sometimes affect the objective judgment of researchers, their funders, and even trial participants. The Jesse Gelsinger case (see Case in Point: Gene Therapy Gone Wrong) is a classic example. Faced with a life-threatening disease and no reasonable treatments available, it is easy to see why a patient might be eager to participate in a clinical trial no matter the risks. It is also easy to see how a researcher might view the short-term risks for a small group of study participants as a small price to pay for the potential benefits of a game-changing new treatment.Gelsinger’s death led to increased scrutiny of gene therapy, and subsequent negative outcomes of gene therapy have resulted in the temporary halting of clinical trials pending further investigation. For example, when children in France treated with gene therapy for SCID began to develop leukemia several years after treatment, the FDA temporarily stopped clinical trials of similar types of gene therapy occurring in the United States.4 Cases like these highlight the need for researchers and health professionals not only to value human well-being and patients’ rights over profitability, but also to maintain scientific objectivity when evaluating the risks and benefits of new therapies.Exercise \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)- Why is gene therapy research so tightly regulated?- What is the main ethical concern associated with germ-line gene therapy?Key Concepts and Summary- While gene therapy shows great promise for the treatment of genetic diseases, there are also significant risks involved.- There is considerable federal and local regulation of the development of gene therapies by pharmaceutical companies for use in humans.- Before gene therapy use can increase dramatically, there are many ethical issues that need to be addressed by the medical and research communities, politicians, and society at large.Footnotes- 1 Barbara Sibbald. “Death but One Unintended Consequence of Gene-Therapy Trial.” Canadian Medical Association Journal 164 no. 11 (2001): 1612–1612.- 2 Kerry Grens. “Report: Ease Gene Therapy Reviews.” The Scientist, December 9, 2013. http://www.the-scientist.com/?articl...erapy-Reviews/.

An organism inherits some genes from each parent and thus the parents pass on certain traits to their offspring.Gene therapy and genetic engineering are two closely related technologies that involve altering the genetic material of organisms. The distinction between the two is based on purpose. Gene therapy seeks to alter genes to correct genetic defects and thus prevent or cure genetic diseases. Genetic engineering aims to modify the genes to enhance the capabilities of the organism beyond what is normal.Ethical controversy surrounds possible use of the both of these technologies in plants, nonhuman animals, and humans. Particularly with genetic engineering, for instance, one wonders whether it would be proper to tinker with human genes to make people able to outperform the greatest Olympic athletes or much smarter than Einstein.Confusing TerminologyIf genetic engineering is meant in a very broad sense to include any intentional genetic alteration, then it includes gene therapy. Thus one hears of “therapeutic genetic engineering” (gene therapy) and “negative genetic engineering” (gene therapy), in contrast with “enhancement genetic engineering” and “positive genetic engineering” (what we call simply “genetic engineering”).We use the phrase “genetic engineering” more narrowly for the kind of alteration that aims at enhancement rather than therapy. We use the term “gene therapy” for efforts to bring people up to normalcy and “genetic engineering” or “enhancement genetic engineering” for efforts to enhancement people’s capabilities beyond normalcy.Somatic Cells and Reproductive CellsTwo fundamental kinds of cell are somatic cells and reproductive cells. Most of the cells in our bodies are somatic – cells that make up organs like skin, liver, heart, lungs, etc., and these cells vary from one another. Changing the genetic material in these cells is not passed along to a person’s offspring. Reproductive cells are sperm cells, egg cells, and cells from very early embryos. Changes in the genetic make-up of reproductive cells would be passed along to the person’s offspring. Those reproductive cell changes could result in different genetics in the offspring’s somatic cells than otherwise would have occurred because the genetic makeup of somatic cells is directly linked to that of the germ cells from which they are derived.Techniques of Genetic AlterationTwo problems must be confronted when changing genes. The first is what kind of change to make to the gene. The second is how to incorporate that change in all the other cells that are must be changed to achieve a desired effect.There are several options for what kind of change to make to the gene. DNA in the gene could be replaced by other DNA from outside (called “homologous replacement). Or the gene could be forced to mutate (change structure – “selective reverse mutation.”) Or a gene could just be added. Or one could use a chemical to simply turn off a gene and prevent it from acting.There are also several options for how to spread the genetic change to all the cells that need to be changed. If the altered cell is a reproductive cell, then a few such cells could be changed and the change would reach the other somatic cells as those somatic cells were created as the organism develops. But if the change were made to a somatic cell, changing all the other relevant somatic cells individually like the first would be impractical due to the sheer number of such cells. The cells of a major organ such as the heart or liver are too numerous to change one-by-one. Instead, to reach such somatic cells a common approach is to use a carrier, or vector, which is a molecule or organism. A virus, for example, could be used as a vector. The virus would be an innocuous one or changed so as not to cause disease. It would be injected with the genetic material and then as it reproduces and “infects” the target cells it would introduce the new genetic material. It would need to be a very specific virus that would infect heart cells, for instance, without infecting and changing all the other cells of the body. Fat particles and chemicals have also been used as vectors because they can penetrate the cell membrane and move into the cell nucleus with the new genetic material.Arguments in Favor of Gene Therapy and Genetic EngineeringGene therapy is often viewed as morally unobjectionable, though caution is urged. The main arguments in its favor are that it offers the potential to cure some diseases or disorders in those who have the problem and to prevent diseases in those whose genes predisposed them to those problems. If done on reproductive cells, gene therapy could keep children from carrying such genes (for unfavorable genetic diseases and disorders) that the children got from their patients.Genetic engineering to enhance organisms has already been used extensively in agriculture, primarily in genetically modified (GM) crops (also known as GMO --genetically modified organisms). For example, crops and stock animals have been engineered so they are resistant to herbicides and pesticides, which means farmers can then use those chemicals to control weeds and insects on those crops without risking harming those plants. In the future genetic enhancement could be used to create crops with greater yields of nutritional value and selective breeding of farm stock, race horses, and show animals.Genetically engineered bacteria and other microorganisms are currently used to produce human insulin, human growth hormone, a protein used in blood clotting, and other pharmaceuticals, and the number of such compounds could increase in the future.Enhancing humans is still in the future, but the basic argument in favor of doing so is that it could make life better in significant ways by enhancing certain characteristics of people. We value intelligence, beauty, strength, endurance, and certain personality characteristics and behavioral tendencies, and if these traits were found to be due to a genetic component we could enhance people by giving them such features. Advocates of genetic engineering point out that many people try to improve themselves in these ways already – by diet, exercise, education, cosmetics, and even plastic surgery. People try to do these things for themselves, and parents try to provide these things for their children. If exercising to improve strength, agility, and overall fitness is a worthwhile goal, and if someone is praised for pursuing education to increase their mental capabilities, then why would it not be worthwhile to accomplish this through genetics?Advocates of genetic engineering also see enhancement as a matter of basic reproductive freedom. We already feel free to pick a mate partly on the basis of the possibility of providing desirable children. We think nothing is wrong with choosing a mate whom we hope might provide smart, attractive kids over some other mate who would provide less desirable children. Choosing a mate for the type of kids one might get is a matter of basic reproductive freedom and we have the freedom to pick the best genes we can for our children. Why, the argument goes, should we have less freedom to give our children the best genes we can through genetic enhancement?Those who advocate making significant modification of humans through technology such as genetic engineering are sometimes called “transhumanists.”Arguments Against Gene TherapyThree arguments sometimes raised against gene therapy are that it is technically too dangerous, that it discriminates or invites discrimination against persons with disabilities, and that it may be becoming increasingly irrelevant in some cases.The danger objection points out that a few recent attempts at gene therapy in clinical trials have made headlines because of the tragic deaths of some of the people participating in the trials. It is not fully known to what extent this was due to the gene therapy itself, as opposed to pre-existing conditions or improper research techniques, but in the light of such events some critics have called for a stop to gene therapy until more is known. We just do not know enough about how gene therapy works and what could go wrong. Specific worries are that- the vectors may deliver the DNA to cells other than the target cells, with unforeseen results- viruses as vectors may not be as innocuous as assumed and may cause disease- adding new genes to a nucleus does not guarantee they will go where desired, with potentially disastrous results if they insert in the wrong place- if the changes are not integrated with other DNA already in the nucleus, the changes may not carry over to new cells and the person may have to undergo more therapy later- changing reproductive cells may cause events not seen until years later, and undesirable effects may have already been passed on to the patient’s childrenThe discrimination objection is as follows. Some people who are physically, mentally, or emotionally impaired are so as the result of genetic factors they have inherited. Such impairment can result in disablement in our society. People with disabilities are often discriminated against by having fewer opportunities than other people. Be removing genetic disorders, and resulting impairment, it is true that gene therapy could contribute to removing one of the sources of discrimination and inequality in society. But the implicit assumption being made, the objection claims, is that people impaired through genetic factors need to be treated and made normal. The objection sees gene therapy as a form of discrimination against impaired people and persons with disabilities.The irrelevance objection is that gene therapy on reproductive cells may in some cases already be superseded by in-vitro fertilization and selection of embryos. If a genetic disorder is such that can be detected in an early embryo, and not all embryos from the parent couple would have it, then have parents produce multiple embryos through in-vitro fertilization and implant only those free from the disorder. In such a case gene therapy would be unnecessary and irrelevant.Arguments Against Genetic EngineeringEthicists have generally been even more concerned about possible problems with and implications of enhancement genetic engineering than they have been about gene therapy. First, there are worries similar to those about gene therapy that not enough is known and there may be unforeseen dangerous consequences. These worries may be even more serious given that the attempts are made not just toward normalcy but into strange new territory where humans have never gone before. We just do not know what freakish creatures might result from experiments gone awry.Following are some other important objections:- Genetic engineering is against the natural or supernatural order. The thought here is that God, or evolution, has created a set of genes for human beings that are either what we should have or that offer us the best survival value. It is against what God or nature intended to tinker with this genetic code, not to bring it up to normal (as in gene therapy), but to create new kinds of beings. This type of objection is compatible both with “creationism,” the belief that God created humans just as they are, and also the belief in evolution. On the latter view, humans consciously enhancing their genes is considered different than allowing the natural process of evolution to “choose” the genes we have.- Genetic engineering is dehumanizing because it will create nonhuman, alienated creatures. Genetically engineered people will be alienated from themselves, or feel a confused identify, or no longer feel human, or the human race will feel alienated from itself. Genetically engineered people won’t have a sense of being part of the human race but they will not have enough in common with other such creatures to feel like they belong with any of them either. People will be alienated even from their radically different genetically engineered children, who could very well be a separate species.- Genetic engineered creatures will suffer from obsolescence. Computers become obsolete quickly as newer models are introduced. But this could happen to genetically engineered people. The hot gene enhancement of one year will be old news several years later. Parents will be obsolete by the standards of their children, and teenagers will be hopelessly outclassed by their younger siblings.- Genetic engineering is a version of eugenics and evokes memories of the historical eugenics movement of the earlier part of the twentieth century in America and Nazi Germany. “Eugenics” is the view that we should improve the genetics of the human race; often advocated are such practices as selective breeding, forced sterilization of “defectives” and “undesirables” (people with genetic disorders or undesirable characteristics or traits, people with disabilities, people of other races, people of other ethnic groups, homosexuals), and euthanasia of such populations. It probably reached an extreme form in Nazi Germany, where mass exterminations took place, but eugenics sentiments existed prior to that in the U.S. These practices are now largely viewed as morally abhorrent. Critics of genetic engineering see it as an attempt at eugenics through technology.Gene therapy is becoming a reality as you read this. Genetic engineering for enhancement is still a ways off.

Particularly with genetic engineering, for instance, one wonders whether it would be proper to tinker with human genes to make people able to outperform the greatest Olympic athletes or much smarter than Einstein.\n\nIf genetic engineering is meant in a very broad sense to include any intentional genetic alteration, then it includes gene therapy. Thus one hears of ""therapeutic genetic engineering"" (gene therapy) and ""negative genetic engineering"" (gene therapy), in contrast with ""enhancement genetic engineering"" and ""positive genetic engineering"" (what we call simply ""genetic engineering"").\n\nWe use the phrase ""genetic engineering"" more narrowly for the kind of alteration that aims at enhancement rather than therapy. We use the term ""gene therapy"" for efforts to bring people up to normalcy and ""genetic engineering"" or ""enhancement genetic engineering"" for efforts to enhancement people\'s capabilities beyond normalcy.\n\nTwo fundamental kinds of cell are somatic cells and reproductive cells. Most of the cells in our bodies are somatic – cells that make up organs like skin, liver, heart, lungs, etc., and these cells vary from one another. Changing the genetic material in these cells is not passed along to a person\'s offspring. Reproductive cells are sperm cells, egg cells, and cells from very early embryos. Changes in the genetic make-up of reproductive cells would be passed along to the person\'s offspring. Those reproductive cell changes could result in different genetics in the offspring\'s somatic cells than otherwise would have occurred because the genetic makeup of somatic cells is directly linked to that of the germ cells from which they are derived.\n\nTwo problems must be confronted when changing genes. The first is what kind of change to make to the gene. The second is how to incorporate that change in all the other cells that are must be changed to achieve a desired effect.\n\nThere are several options for what kind of change to make to the gene. DNA in the gene could be replaced by other DNA from outside (called ""homologous replacement). Or the gene could be forced to mutate (change structure – ""selective reverse mutation."") Or a gene could just be added. Or one could use a chemical to simply turn off a gene and prevent it from acting.\n\nThere are also several options for how to spread the genetic change to all the cells that need to be changed. If the altered cell is a reproductive cell, then a few such cells could be changed and the change would reach the other somatic cells as those somatic cells were created as the organism develops. But if the change were made to a somatic cell, changing all the other relevant somatic cells individually like the first would be impractical due to the sheer number of such cells. The cells of a major organ such as the heart or liver are too numerous to change one-by-one. Instead, to reach such somatic cells a common approach is to use a carrier, or vector, which is a molecule or organism. A virus, for example, could be used as a vector. The virus would be an innocuous one or changed so as not to cause disease. It would be injected with the genetic material and then as it reproduces and ""infects"" the target cells it would introduce the new genetic material. It would need to be a very specific virus that would infect heart cells, for instance, without infecting and changing all the other cells of the body. Fat particles and chemicals have also been used as vectors because they can penetrate the cell membrane and move into the cell nucleus with the new genetic material.\n\nGene therapy is often viewed as morally unobjectionable, though caution is urged. The main arguments in its favor are that it offers the potential to cure some diseases or disorders in those who have the problem and to prevent diseases in those whose genes predisposed them to those problems. If done on reproductive cells, gene therapy could keep children from carrying such genes (for unfavorable genetic diseases and disorders) that the children got from their patients.\n\nGenetic engineering to enhance organisms has already been used extensively in agriculture, primarily in genetically modified (GM) crops (also known as GMO --genetically modified organisms). For example, crops and stock animals have been engineered so they are resistant to herbicides and pesticides, which means farmers can then use those chemicals to control weeds and insects on those crops without risking harming those plants. In the future genetic enhancement could be used to create crops with greater yields of nutritional value and selective breeding of farm stock, race horses, and show animals.\n\nGenetically engineered bacteria and other microorganisms are currently used to produce human insulin, human growth hormone, a protein used in blood clotting, and other pharmaceuticals, and the number of such compounds could increase in the future.\nEnhancing humans is still in the future, but the basic argument in favor of doing so is that it could make life better in significant ways by enhancing certain characteristics of people. We value intelligence, beauty, strength, endurance, and certain personality characteristics and behavioral tendencies, and if these traits were found to be due to a genetic component we could enhance people by giving them such features. Advocates of genetic engineering point out that many people try to improve themselves in these ways already – by diet, exercise, education, cosmetics, and even plastic surgery. People try to do these things for themselves, and parents try to provide these things for their children. If exercising to improve strength, agility, and overall fitness is a worthwhile goal, and if someone is praised for pursuing education to increase their mental capabilities, then why would it not be worthwhile to accomplish this through genetics?\n\nAdvocates of genetic engineering also see enhancement as a matter of basic reproductive freedom. We already feel free to pick a mate partly on the basis of the possibility of providing desirable children. We think nothing is wrong with choosing a mate whom we hope might provide smart, attractive kids over some other mate who would provide less desirable children. Choosing a mate for the type of kids one might get is a matter of basic reproductive freedom and we have the freedom to pick the best genes we can for our children. Why, the argument goes, should we have less freedom to give our children the best genes we can through genetic enhancement?\n\nThree arguments sometimes raised against gene therapy are that it is technically too dangerous, that it discriminates or invites discrimination against persons with disabilities, and that it may be becoming increasingly irrelevant in some cases.\nThe danger objection points out that a few recent attempts at gene therapy in clinical trial'}, {'raw_text': 'Two new companion reports released today by the World Health Organization (WHO) provide the first global recommendations to help establish human genome editing as a toolfor public health, with an emphasis on safety, effectiveness and ethics.The forward-looking new reports result from the first broad, global consultation looking at somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing.

**Potential Benefits:**
The primary benefit is the potential to eradicate or treat inherited diseases. Globally, over 6,000 known single-gene disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease, affect millions of people. Gene editing could correct the faulty genes responsible, offering permanent cures rather than just managing symptoms.

**Dangers and Ethical Concerns:**
The risks include unintended ""off-target"" mutations and unforeseen long-term health consequences. Ethically, concerns center on the potential for creating ""designer babies,"" leading to a genetic divide between the rich and poor. The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted these risks, calling for robust global governance and oversight on human genome editing **(Source: WHO)**.

what does visible light mean,"['informational', 'simple', 'science', 'non-technical', 'research', 'non-sensitive']","[{'raw_text': 'Visible spectrumThe visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to about 750 nanometers.[1] In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 400–790 terahertz. These boundaries are not sharply defined and may vary per individual.[2] Under optimal conditions these limits of human perception can extend to 310 nm (ultraviolet) and 1100 nm (near infrared).[3][4][5] The optical spectrum is sometimes considered to be the same as the visible spectrum, but some authors define the term more broadly, to include the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum as well.[6]The spectrum does not contain all the colors that the human visual system can distinguish. Unsaturated colors such as pink, or purple variations like magenta, for example, are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths. Colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors or spectral colors.[7]Visible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the Earth\'s atmosphere via the ""optical window"" region of the electromagnetic spectrum. An example of this phenomenon is when clean air scatters blue light more than red light, and so the midday sky appears blue (apart from the area around the Sun which appears white because the light is not scattered as much). The optical window is also referred to as the ""visible window"" because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum. The near infrared (NIR) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) window, and the long-wavelength or far-infrared (LWIR or FIR) window, although other animals may perceive them.Spectral colors[edit]|Color|Wavelength(nm)|Frequency(THz)|Photon energy(eV)|380–450|670–790|2.75–3.26|450–485|620–670|2.56–2.75|485–500|600–620|2.48–2.56|500–565|530–600|2.19–2.48|565–590|510–530|2.10–2.19|590–625|480–510|1.98–2.10|625–750|400–480|1.65–1.98Colors that can be produced by visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (monochromatic light) are called pure spectral colors. The various color ranges indicated in the illustration are an approximation: The spectrum is continuous, with no clear boundaries between one color and the next.[8]History[edit]In the 13th century, Roger Bacon theorized that rainbows were produced by a similar process to the passage of light through glass or crystal.[9]In the 17th century, Isaac Newton discovered that prisms could disassemble and reassemble white light, and described the phenomenon in his book Opticks. He was the first to use the word spectrum (Latin for ""appearance"" or ""apparition"") in this sense in print in 1671 in describing his experiments in optics. Newton observed that, when a narrow beam of sunlight strikes the face of a glass prism at an angle, some is reflected and some of the beam passes into and through the glass, emerging as different-colored bands. Newton hypothesized light to be made up of ""corpuscles"" (particles) of different colors, with the different colors of light moving at different speeds in transparent matter, red light moving more quickly than violet in glass. The result is that red light is bent (refracted) less sharply than violet as it passes through the prism, creating a spectrum of colors.Newton originally divided the spectrum into six named colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. He later added indigo as the seventh color since he believed that seven was a perfect number as derived from the ancient Greek sophists, of there being a connection between the colors, the musical notes, the known objects in the Solar System, and the days of the week.[10] The human eye is relatively insensitive to indigo\'s frequencies, and some people who have otherwise-good vision cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet. For this reason, some later commentators, including Isaac Asimov,[11] have suggested that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet. Evidence indicates that what Newton meant by ""indigo"" and ""blue"" does not correspond to the modern meanings of those color words. Comparing Newton\'s observation of prismatic colors with a color image of the visible light spectrum shows that ""indigo"" corresponds to what is today called blue, whereas his ""blue"" corresponds to cyan.[12][13][14]In the 18th century, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote about optical spectra in his Theory of Colours. Goethe used the word spectrum (Spektrum) to designate a ghostly optical afterimage, as did Schopenhauer in On Vision and Colors. Goethe argued that the continuous spectrum was a compound phenomenon. Where Newton narrowed the beam of light to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that a wider aperture produces not a spectrum but rather reddish-yellow and blue-cyan edges with white between them. The spectrum appears only when these edges are close enough to overlap.In the early 19th century, the concept of the visible spectrum became more definite, as light outside the visible range was discovered and characterized by William Herschel (infrared) and Johann Wilhelm Ritter (ultraviolet), Thomas Young, Thomas Johann Seebeck, and others.[15] Young was the first to measure the wavelengths of different colors of light, in 1802.[16]The connection between the visible spectrum and color vision was explored by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early 19th century. Their theory of color vision correctly proposed that the eye uses three distinct receptors to perceive color.Limits to visible range[edit]The visible spectrum is limited to wavelengths that can both reach the retina and trigger visual phototransduction (excite a visual opsin). Insensitivity to UV light is generally limited by transmission through the lens. Insensitivity to IR light is limited by the spectral sensitivity functions of the visual opsins. The range is defined psychometrically by the luminous efficiency function, which accounts for all of these factors. In humans, there is a separate function for each of two visual systems, one for photopic vision, used in daylight, which is mediated by cone cells, and one for scotopic vision, used in dim light, which is mediated by rod cells. Each of these functions have different visible ranges. However, discussion on the visible range generally assumes photopic vision.Atmospheric transmission[edit]The visible range of most animals evolved to match the optical window, which is the range of light that can pass through the atmosphere. The ozone layer absorbs almost all UVA light (below 315 nm).[17] However, this only affects cosmic light (e.g. sunlight), not terrestrial light (e.g. Bioluminescence).Ocular transmission[edit]Before reaching the retina, light must first transmit through the cornea and lens. UVB light (< 315 nm) is filtered mostly by the cornea, and UVA light (315–400 nm) is filtered mostly by the lens.[18] The lens also yellows with age, attenuating transmission mostly strongly at the blue part of the spectrum.[18] This can cause xanthopsia as well as a slight truncation of the short-wave (blue) limit of the visible spectrum. Subjects with aphakia are missing a lens, so UVA light can reach the retina and excite the visual opsins; this expands the visible range and may also lead to cyanopsia.Opsin absorption[edit]Each opsin has a spectral sensitivity function, which defines how likely it is to absorb a photon of each wavelength. The luminous efficiency function is approximately the superposition of the contributing visual opsins. Variance in the position of the individual opsin spectral sensitivity functions therefore affects the luminous efficiency function and the visible range. For example, the long-wave (red) limit changes proportionally to the position of the L-opsin. The positions are defined by the peak wavelength (wavelength of highest sensitivity), so as the L-opsin peak wavelength blue shifts by 10 nm, the long-wave limit of the visible spectrum also shifts 10 nm. Large deviations of the L-opsin peak wavelength lead to a form of color blindness called protanomaly and a missing L-opsin (protanopia) shortens the visible spectrum by about 30 nm at the long-wave limit. Forms of color blindness affecting the M-opsin and S-opsin do not significantly affect the luminous efficiency function nor the limits of the visible spectrum.Different definitions[edit]Regardless of actual physical and biological variance, the definition of the limits is not standard and will change depending on the industry. For example, some industries may be concerned with practical limits, so would conservatively report 420–680 nm,[19][20] while others may be concerned with psychometrics and achieving the broadest spectrum would liberally report 380–750, or even 380–800 nm.[21][22] The luminous efficiency function in the NIR does not have a hard cutoff, but rather an exponential decay, such that the function\'s value (or vision sensitivity) at 1,050 nm is about 109 times weaker than at 700 nm; much higher intensity is therefore required to perceive 1,050 nm light than 700 nm light.[23]Vision outside the visible spectrum[edit]Under ideal laboratory conditions, subjects may perceive infrared light up to at least 1,064 nm.[23] While 1,050 nm NIR light can evoke red, suggesting direct absorption by the L-opsin, there are also reports that pulsed NIR lasers can evoke green, which suggests two-photon absorption may be enabling extended NIR sensitivity.[23]Similarly, young subjects may perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about 310–313 nm,[24][25][26] but detection of light below 380 nm may be due to fluorescence of the ocular media, rather than direct absorption of UV light by the opsins. As UVA light is absorbed by the ocular media (lens and cornea), it may fluoresce and be released at a lower energy (longer wavelength) that can then be absorbed by the opsins. For example, when the lens absorbs 350 nm light, the fluorescence emission spectrum is centered on 440 nm.[27]Non-visual light detection[edit]In addition to the photopic and scotopic systems, humans have other systems for detecting light that do not contribute to the primary visual system. For example, melanopsin has an absorption range of 420–540 nm and regulates circadian rhythm and other reflexive processes.[28] Since the melanopsin system does not form images, it is not strictly considered vision and does not contribute to the visible range.In non-humans[edit]The visible spectrum is defined as that visible to humans, but the variance between species is large. Not only can cone opsins be spectrally shifted to alter the visible range, but vertebrates with 4 cones (tetrachromatic) or 2 cones (dichromatic) relative to humans\' 3 (trichromatic) will also tend to have a wider or narrower visible spectrum than humans, respectively.Vertebrates tend to have 1-4 different opsin classes:[17]- longwave sensitive (LWS) with peak sensitivity between 500–570 nm,- middlewave sensitive (MWS) with peak sensitivity between 480–520 nm,- shortwave sensitive (SWS) with peak sensitivity between 415–470 nm, and- violet/ultraviolet sensitive (VS/UVS) with peak sensitivity between 355–435 nm.Testing the visual systems of animals behaviorally is difficult, so the visible range of animals is usually estimated by comparing the peak wavelengths of opsins with those of typical humans (S-opsin at 420 nm and L-opsin at 560 nm).Mammals[edit]Most mammals have retained only two opsin classes (LWS and VS), due likely to the nocturnal bottleneck. However, old world primates (including humans) have since evolved two versions in the LWS class to regain trichromacy.[17] Unlike most mammals, rodents\' UVS opsins have remained at shorter wavelengths. Along with their lack of UV filters in the lens, mice have a UVS opsin that can detect down to 340 nm. While allowing UV light to reach the retina can lead to retinal damage, the short lifespan of mice compared with other mammals may minimize this disadvantage relative to the advantage of UV vision.[29] Dogs have two cone opsins at 429 nm and 555 nm, so see almost the entire visible spectrum of humans, despite being dichromatic.[30] Horses have two cone opsins at 428 nm and 539 nm, yielding a slightly more truncated red vision.[31]Birds[edit]Most other vertebrates (birds, lizards, fish, etc.) have retained their tetrachromacy, including UVS opsins that extend further into the ultraviolet than humans\' VS opsin.[17] The sensitivity of avian UVS opsins vary greatly, from 355–425 nm, and LWS opsins from 560–570 nm.[32] This translates to some birds with a visible spectrum on par with humans, and other birds with greatly expanded sensitivity to UV light. The LWS opsin of birds is sometimes reported to have a peak wavelength above 600 nm, but this is an effective peak wavelength that incorporates the filter of avian oil droplets.[32] The peak wavelength of the LWS opsin alone is the better predictor of the long-wave limit. A possible benefit of avian UV vision involves sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.[33][34]Fish[edit]Teleosts (bony fish) are generally tetrachromatic. The sensitivity of fish UVS opsins vary from 347-383 nm, and LWS opsins from 500-570 nm.[35] However, some fish that use alternative chromophores can extend their LWS opsin sensitivity to 625 nm.[35] The popular belief that the common goldfish is the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light[36] is incorrect, because goldfish cannot see infrared light.[37]Invertebrates[edit]The visual systems of invertebrates deviate greatly from vertebrates, so direct comparisons are difficult. However, UV sensitivity has been reported in most insect species.[38] Bees and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them find nectar in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet light rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Bees\' long-wave limit is at about 590 nm.[39] Mantis shrimp exhibit up to 14 opsins, enabling a visible range of less than 300 nm to above 700 nm.[17]Thermal vision[edit]Some snakes can ""see""[40] radiant heat at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm to a degree of accuracy such that a blind rattlesnake can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes,[41] and other snakes with the organ may detect warm bodies from a meter away.[42] It may also be used in thermoregulation and predator detection.[43][44]Spectroscopy[edit]Spectroscopy is the study of objects based on the spectrum of color they emit, absorb or reflect. Visible-light spectroscopy is an important tool in astronomy (as is spectroscopy at other wavelengths), where scientists use it to analyze the properties of distant objects. Chemical elements and small molecules can be detected in astronomical objects by observing emission lines and absorption lines. For example, Helium was first detected by analysis of the spectrum of the Sun. The shift in frequency of spectral lines is used to measure the Doppler shift (redshift or blueshift) of distant objects to determine their velocities towards or away from the observer. Astronomical spectroscopy uses high-dispersion diffraction gratings to observe spectra at very high spectral resolutions.See also[edit]- High-energy visible light- Cosmic ray visual phenomena- Electromagnetic absorption by water- Two-photon absorption - A method for seeing outside the visible spectrumReferences[edit]- ^ Starr, Cecie (2005).

ISBN 0-9630537-0-1.', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum', 'cleaned_text': 'The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to about 750 nanometers. In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 400–790 terahertz. These boundaries are not sharply defined and may vary per individual. Under optimal conditions these limits of human perception can extend to 310 nm (ultraviolet) and 1100 nm (near infrared). The optical spectrum is sometimes considered to be the same as the visible spectrum, but some authors define the term more broadly, to include the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum as well.\n\nThe spectrum does not contain all the colors that the human visual system can distinguish. Unsaturated colors such as pink, or purple variations like magenta, for example, are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths. Colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors or spectral colors.\n\nVisible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the Earth\'s atmosphere via the ""optical window"" region of the electromagnetic spectrum. An example of this phenomenon is when clean air scatters blue light more than red light, and so the midday sky appears blue (apart from the area around the Sun which appears white because the light is not scattered as much). The optical window is also referred to as the ""visible window"" because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum. The near infrared (NIR) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) window, and the long-wavelength or far-infrared (LWIR or FIR) window, although other animals may perceive them.\n\nColors that can be produced by visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (monochromatic light) are called pure spectral colors. The various color ranges indicated in the illustration are an approximation: The spectrum is continuous, with no clear boundaries between one color and the next.\n\nIn the 13th century, Roger Bacon theorized that rainbows were produced by a similar process to the passage of light through glass or crystal.\nIn the 17th century, Isaac Newton discovered that prisms could disassemble and reassemble white light, and described the phenomenon in his book Opticks. He was the first to use the word spectrum (Latin for ""appearance"" or ""apparition"") in this sense in print in 1671 in describing his experiments in optics. Newton observed that, when a narrow beam of sunlight strikes the face of a glass prism at an angle, some is reflected and some of the beam passes into and through the glass, emerging as different-colored bands. Newton hypothesized light to be made up of ""corpuscles"" (particles) of different colors, with the different colors of light moving at different speeds in transparent matter, red light moving more quickly than violet in glass. The result is that red light is bent (refracted) less sharply than violet as it passes through the prism, creating a spectrum of colors.\n\nNewton originally divided the spectrum into six named colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. He later added indigo as the seventh color since he believed that seven was a perfect number as derived from the ancient Greek sophists, of there being a connection between the colors, the musical notes, the known objects in the Solar System, and the days of the week. The human eye is relatively insensitive to indigo\'s frequencies, and some people who have otherwise-good vision cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet. For this reason, some later commentators, including Isaac Asimov, have suggested that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet. Evidence indicates that what Newton meant by ""indigo"" and ""blue"" does not correspond to the modern meanings of those color words. Comparing Newton\'s observation of prismatic colors with a color image of the visible light spectrum shows that ""indigo"" corresponds to what is today called blue, whereas his ""blue"" corresponds to cyan.\n\nIn the 18th century, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote about optical spectra in his Theory of Colours. Goethe used the word spectrum (Spektrum) to designate a ghostly optical afterimage, as did Schopenhauer in On Vision and Colors. Goethe argued that the continuous spectrum was a compound phenomenon. Where Newton narrowed the beam of light to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that a wider aperture produces not a spectrum but rather reddish-yellow and blue-cyan edges with white between them. The spectrum appears only when these edges are close enough to overlap.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the concept of the visible spectrum became more definite, as light outside the visible range was discovered and characterized by William Herschel (infrared) and Johann Wilhelm Ritter (ultraviolet), Thomas Young, Thomas Johann Seebeck, and others. Young was the first to measure the wavelengths of different colors of light, in 1802.\n\nThe connection between the visible spectrum and color vision was explored by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early 19th century. Their theory of color vision correctly proposed that the eye uses three distinct receptors to perceive color.\n\nThe visible spectrum is limited to wavelengths that can both reach the retina and trigger visual phototransduction (excite a visual opsin). Insensitivity to UV light is generally limited by transmission through the lens. Insensitivity to IR light is limited by the spectral sensitivity functions of the visual opsins. The range is defined psychometrically by the luminous efficiency function, which accounts for all of these factors. In humans, there is a separate function for each of two visual systems, one for photopic vision, used in daylight, which is mediated by cone cells, and one for scotopic vision, used in dim light, which is mediated by rod cells. Each of these functions have different visible ranges. However, discussion on the visible range generally assumes photopic vision.\n\nThe visible range of most animals evolved to match the optical window, which is the range of light that can pass through the atmosphere. The ozone layer absorbs almost all UVA light (below 315 nm). However, this only affects cosmic light (e.g. sunlight), not terrestrial light (e.g. Bioluminescence).\n\nBefore reaching the retina, light must first transmit through the cornea and lens. UVB light (< 315 nm) is filtered mostly by the cornea, and UVA light (315–400 nm) is filtered mostly by the lens. The lens also yellows with age, attenuating transmission mostly strongly at the blue part of the spectrum. This can cause xanthopsia as well as a slight truncation of the short-wave (blue) limit of the visible spectrum. Subjects with aphakia are missing a lens, so UVA light can reach the retina and excite the visual opsins; this expands the visible range and may also lead to cyanopsia.\n\nEach opsin has a spectral sensitivity function, which defines how likely it is to absorb a photon of each wavelength. The luminous efficiency function is approximately the superposition of the contributing visual opsins. Variance in the position of the individual opsin spectral sensitivity functions therefore affects the luminous efficiency function and the visible range. For example, the long-wave (red) limit changes proportionally to the position of the L-opsin. The positions\n\n'}, {'raw_text': 'Science, Tech, Math › Science Visible Light Definition and Wavelengths Print A prism breaks white light into its component colors.

Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on January 09, 2020 Visible light is a range of electromagnetic radiation that can be detected by the human eye. The wavelengths associated with this range are 380 to 750 nanometers (nm) while the frequency range is approximately 430 to 750 terahertz (THz). The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between infrared and ultraviolet. Infrared radiation, microwaves, and radio waves are lower frequency/longer wavelength than visible light, while ultraviolet light, x-radiation, and gamma radiation are higher frequency/shorter wavelength than visible light. Key Takeaways: What Is Visible Light? Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum perceived by the human eye. Sometimes it is simply called ""light.""The approximate range of visible light is between infrared and ultraviolet, which is 380-750 nm or 430-750 THz. However, age and other factors can affect this range, as some people can see infrared and ultraviolet light.The visible spectrum is roughly divided into colors, which are usually called red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. However, these divisions are unequal in size and somewhat arbitrary.The study of visible light and its interaction with matter is called optics. Units There are two sets of units used to measure visible light. Radiometry measures all wavelengths of light, while photometry measures light with respect to human perception. SI radiometric units include the joule (J) for radiant energy and watt (W) for radiant flux. SI photometric units include the lumen (lm) for luminous flux, lumen second (lm⋅s) or talbot for luminous energy, candela (cd) for luminous intensity, and lux (lx) for illuminance or luminous flux incident on a surface. Variations in the Range of Visible Light The human eye perceives light when sufficient energy interacts with the molecule retinal in the eye\'s retina. The energy changes the molecular conformation, triggering a nerve impulse that registers in the brain. Depending on whether a rod or cone is activated, light/dark or color may be perceived. Humans are active during daylight hours, which means our eyes are exposed to sunlight. Sunlight has a strong ultraviolet component, which damages rods and cones. So, the eye has built-in ultraviolet filters to protect vision. The cornea of the eye absorbs most ultraviolet light (below 360 nm), while the lens absorbs ultraviolet light below 400 nm. However, the human eye can perceive ultraviolet light. People who have a lens removed (called aphakia) or have cataract surgery and get an artificial lens report seeing ultraviolet light. Birds, bees, and many other animals also perceive ultraviolet light. Most animals that see ultraviolet light cannot see red or infrared. Under laboratory conditions, people can often see as far as 1050 nm into the infrared region. After that point, the energy of infrared radiation in too low to produce the molecular conformation change needed to trigger a signal. Colors of Visible Light The colors of visible light are called the visible spectrum. The colors of the spectrum correspond to wavelength ranges. Sir Isaac Newton divided the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. He later added indigo, but Newton\'s ""indigo"" was closer to modern ""blue,"" while his ""blue"" more closely resembled modern ""cyan."" The color names and wavelength ranges are somewhat arbitrary, but they follow a sequence from infrared to ultraviolet of infrared, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo (in some sources), and violet. Modern scientists refer to colors by their wavelength rather than name, to avoid any confusion.

Visible light is just one of many types of EM radiation, and occupies a very small range of the overall electromagnetic spectrum but because we can see light with our eyes, it has special significance to us.Light waves have wavelengths between about 400 and 700 nanometers (4,000 to 7,000 angstroms). Our eyes perceive different wavelengths of light as the rainbow hues of colors. Red light has relatively long waves, around 700 nm long. Blue and purple light have short waves, around 400 nm. Shorter waves vibrate at higher frequencies and have higher energies. Red light has a frequency around 430 terahertz, while blue\'s frequency is closer to 750 terahertz. Red photons of light carry about 1.8 electron volts (eV) of energy, while each blue photon transmits about 3.1 eV.Visible light\'s neighbors on the EM spectrum are infrared radiation on the one side and ultraviolet radiation on the other. Infrared radiation has longer waves than red light, and thus oscillates at a lower frequency and carries less energy. Ultraviolet radiation has shorter waves than blue or violet light, and thus oscillates more rapidly and carries more energy per photon than visible light does.Light travels at a speed of 299,792 kilometers per second (about 186,282 miles per second). At this speed, light could circle Earth more than seven times in one second! The lowercase letter ""c"" is often used to represent the speed of light in equations, such as Einstein\'s famous relation between energy and matter: E = mc2. All forms of electromagnetic waves, including X-rays and radio waves and all other frequencies across the EM spectrum, also travel at the speed of light. Light travels most rapidly in a vacuum, and moves slightly slower in materials like water or glass.When light passes from one material to another material with a different density, is usually bends or changes course. Different colors of light bend by slightly different amounts. When blue light passes from air through a dense glass prism, for example, it bends slightly more than red light does. This is why a prism breaks white light up into a rainbow of different colors. Raindrops can become natural prisms, causing rainbows when sunlight passes through.© 2018 UCAR with portions adapted from Windows to the Universe (© 2005 NESTA)', 'url': 'https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/visible-light', 'cleaned_text': 'Visible light is one way energy moves around.

More simply, this range of wavelengths is called visible light. Typically, the human eye can detect wavelengths from 380 to 700 nanometers.WAVELENGTHS OF VISIBLE LIGHTAll electromagnetic radiation is light, but we can only see a small portion of this radiation—the portion we call visible light. Cone-shaped cells in our eyes act as receivers tuned to the wavelengths in this narrow band of the spectrum. Other portions of the spectrum have wavelengths too large or too small and energetic for the biological limitations of our perception.As the full spectrum of visible light travels through a prism, the wavelengths separate into the colors of the rainbow because each color is a different wavelength. Violet has the shortest wavelength, at around 380 nanometers, and red has the longest wavelength, at around 700 nanometers.THE SUN\'S CORONAThe Sun is the dominant source for visible-light waves our eyes receive. The outer-most layer of the Sun\'s atmosphere, the corona, can be seen in visible light. But it is so faint it cannot not be seen except during a total solar eclipse because the bright photosphere overwhelms it. The photograph below was taken during a total eclipse of the Sun where the photosphere and chromosphere are almost completely blocked by the moon. The tapered patterns—coronal streamers—around the Sun are formed by the outward flow of plasma that is shaped by magnetic field lines extending millions of miles into space.COLOR AND TEMPERATUREAs objects grow hotter, they radiate energy dominated by shorter wavelengths, changing color before our eyes. A flame on a blow torch shifts from reddish to bluish in color as it is adjusted to burn hotter. In the same way, the color of stars tells scientists about their temperature.Our Sun produces more yellow light than any other color because its surface temperature is 5,500°C. If the Sun\'s surface were cooler—say 3,000°C—it would look reddish, like the star Betelgeuse. If the Sun were hotter—say, 12,000°C—it would look blue, like the star Rigel.Isaac Newton\'s experiment in 1665 showed that a prism bends visible light and that each color refracts at a slightly different angle depending on the wavelength of the color.SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL SIGNATURESClose examination of the visible-light spectrum from our Sun and other stars reveals a pattern of dark lines—called absorption lines. These patterns can provide important scientific clues that reveal hidden properties of objects throughout the universe. Certain elements in the Sun\'s atmosphere absorb certain colors of light. These patterns of lines within spectra act like fingerprints for atoms and molecules. Looking at the Sun\'s spectrum, for example, the fingerprints for elements are clear to those knowledgeable about those patterns.Patterns are also evident in a graph of an object\'s reflectance. Elements, molecules, and even cell structures have unique signatures of reflectance. A graph of an object\'s reflectance across a spectrum is called a spectral signature. Spectral signatures of different Earth features within the visible light spectrum ARE shown below.ACTIVE REMOTE SENSING—ALTIMETRYLaser altimetry is an example of active remote sensing using visible light. NASA\'s Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) enabled scientists to calculate the elevation of Earth\'s polar ice sheets using lasers and ancillary data. Changes in elevation over time help to estimate variations in the amount of water stored as ice on our planet. The image below shows elevation data over the West Antarctic Ice Streams.Laser altimeters can also make unique measurements of the heights and characteristics of clouds, as well as the top and structure of the vegetation canopy of forests. They can also sense the distribution of aerosols from sources such as dust storms and forest fires.Top of Page | Next: Ultraviolet WavesCitationAPANational Aeronautics and Space Administration, Science Mission Directorate.

It is the light we perceive as the colors of the rainbow.

This portion of the spectrum corresponds to a wavelength range of approximately **380 to 740 nanometers** (nm). According to **NASA**, this narrow band is situated between the invisible ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) regions of the spectrum (Source: NASA Science). All the colors we see, from violet to red, exist within this specific range.

As the **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)** noted during the International Year of Light, light is fundamental to our existence. Physicist William Lawrence Bragg emphasized its importance, stating, ""The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to discover new ways of thinking about them."" This perspective is crucial for understanding phenomena like visible light, which shapes our entire perception of reality."

For that, you need fossilized poop, called coprolites.“These little magic packages can provide really special perspectives on ancient life,” says Karen Chin, an associate professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder.“Skeletal fossils don’t always tell you too much about the behavior of animals,” she says. “In addition to diet, [coprolites] can also tell you about what organisms might have been living along with the animal that defecated, and coprolites can also tell you about the conditions under which they were preserved.”Everyone poops. This adage even applies to prehistoric creatures—from crustaceans to dinosaurs—that lived on land and in the sea. Over the course of any given organism’s lifespan, piles of poop were produced countless times. Unfortunately for those seeking fossilized examples of excrement, poop just doesn’t fossilize as well as bones or shells. Ancient feces fossilized only if a mineralizing agent covered it relatively quickly after it was produced. If mineralization was successful and decomposition was avoided, then feces could fossilize, forming a coprolite.While it may seem like a less glamorous side of science, the study of petrified poo is incredibly important.When Chin began studying these coprolites, she found they contained unexpected surprises. Coprolites from herbivorous dinosaurs had more than just leaf matter inside of them. She found dung beetle burrows, snail shells, and tiny pieces of conifer wood. The pieces of conifer wood were no ordinary pieces of wood—they had actually been rotting before being ingested. This is incredibly intriguing as rotting wood isn’t on the diet of many organisms, even herbivores such as these dinosaurs.In Choteau Mountain’s Two Medicine Formation in Montana and the Kaiparowits Formation in Utah, fossil body parts, coprolites, and trace fossils, which are fossilized indicators of an organism’s presence, can be found. These two formations contain fossils dating back to the late Cretaceous period, which is the period just before dinosaurs went extinct. Famous dinosaurs such as triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the area, and fossils of these species along with many other creatures, are found in the Two Medicine and Kaiparowits Formations.For this activity, you’ll step into the shoes of Karen Chin to see what you’re able to gather from coprolite samples from the Two Medicine and Kaiparowits Formations. You’ll try to answer the same question Dr. Chin pondered: Why is there wood in the fossilized poop created by herbivorous dinosaurs?Discovering The Past Through Dino PoopAnalyze Your Own Dino Poop TreasuresMaterials Per Pair Of Students- Small containers of children’s modeling clay like Play-Doh or a Play-Doh-like substance. Be sure to have at least three different colors. One color for coprolites from each formation and one to represent fossilized dung beetle tunnels- Small shell noodles to represent snail shells- Pieces of bark, softer wood that may be beginning to decompose is even better than mulch- Oatmeal to represent remnants of invertebrates- Pieces of tri-colored Rotini noodles to represent remnants of fungi- Plastic knife- Wax paper- A set of student handouts (digital or printable PDF)Teacher Preparation Notes- Use the following Teacher’s guide to create your coprolites.- Do NOT show the students the Science Friday video before the activity.- Create coprolites before the activity begins. Give yourself 2-3 days for the material to dry out and harden enough to be useful for the activity.- Be sure to keep track of your color code for the Two Medicine Formation in Choteau Montana and Utah’s Kaiparowits Formation.Teacher Directions- Arrange students into groups of 2-4. Provide half of the group with coprolites from the Two Medicine Formation and the other half with coprolites from the Kaiparowits Formation. Each student should be provided with a plastic knife, a portion of wax-paper upon which to place their coprolite and conduct their investigation, and a student guide (there is a separate student guide for the Kaiparowits and Two Medicine Formations).- Tell your students they have been asked to join a scientific team studying coprolites, or fossilized feces, to learn more about the daily habits and diets of dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous. Their job will be to study coprolites for fossil clues about eating habits of dinosaurs from that time in addition to figuring out why pieces of rotting wood are found in the coprolites of herbivorous dinosaurs in these two formations.- Provide students 5 minutes to observe and record the surface features of their coprolites and record them in their student guide.- Show students how to create a cross-section of a coprolite using the plastic knife on top of the wax paper, and one of the coprolites you prepared earlier. To create a cross-section simply cut a thin slice, no thicker than 1 centimeter, from your coprolite in whichever direction is easiest or most convenient. If there are any pieces that are too big or can’t be cut within the cross-section tell the students they can remove these sections from the coprolite and observe them with the cross-section.- Provide students 15 minutes to cut cross-sections of their coprolite as well as sketch and record their findings, there are 3 sections provided in this activity for them to do so. If your students create more than 3 cross-sections, encourage them to create their own extension of the handout on a separate piece of paper to continue recording their data.- Provide 20 minutes for students to work by themselves or with another student who investigated a coprolite from the same formation to create a hypothesis about the origin of the material they found inside their coprolite, and another hypothesis as to why pieces of rotting wood have been found in the coprolites of herbivorous dinosaurs. Students should do so based on their findings from their own coprolite.- Provide 10 minutes for students to share their findings with students who investigated the coprolite(s) from the other formation. Focus on sharing the characteristics of the coprolites from both formations and the reasoning why rotting wood is found in coprolites from herbivorous dinosaurs.Student DirectionsFollow the coprolite dissection procedure to create cross-sections of your coprolite, then sketch and describe your coprolite cross-sections. Label any important pieces or materials that you find within the fossilized feces. You should repeat this process several times to get the complete picture of what the eating habits of the dinosaur that created this coprolite were.By yourself, or with a partner who investigated coprolites from the same formation, create a summary of what you found within your coprolite. Be sure to cite specifics such as what exactly you found, how much of it, and where. After completing your summary use the time allowed by your teacher to explain why pieces of rotting wood could be found in coprolites of herbivorous dinosaurs from your formation using your findingsShare your findings and hypothesis with your group who were studying coprolites from the other formation. After sharing your findings with each other, create a group conclusion about the habits of these dinosaurs and a hypothesis as to why these herbivorous dinosaurs regularly had rotting wood in their feces. How do the findings from the other formation support or conflict with your original hypothesis? Be sure to provide specific examples from the exploration of the coprolites from both formations to support your claim.What The Scientists FoundBased on her conclusions, Karen Chin concluded that dinosaurs didn’t purposefully eat conifer or pine tree wood. The presence of wood that was rotting was confusing to scientists as it generally isn’t believed that herbivorous dinosaurs ate wood as part of their diet. Through extensive testing, however, it was determined that the wood that was being found was rotting before it was eaten by dinosaurs. Chin hypothesized that the wood being consumed was being consumed on accident by the dinosaurs that were eating it. She postulated that the dinosaurs were ingesting the wood as they were trying to eat the insects that were living in or on the rotting wood meaning the dinosaurs were actually omnivores instead of herbivores. Scientists researching in the Kaiparowits Formation supported her hypothesis when they found fossilized remnants of the same insects and other organisms in the coprolites of herbivorous dinosaurs as well.Reflection Questions- Coprolites helped support an important discovery about herbivorous species. What could be discovered about carnivorous dinosaurs using their coprolites?- What do you think coprolites from dinosaurs that live off of scavenging such as vultures today could reveal about how those organisms lived?20 years from now, while working in your paleontology lab investigating the coprolites of carnivorous dinosaurs you notice they contain a significant amount of plant material.

If there are any pieces that are too big or can’t be cut within the cross-section tell the students they can remove these sections from the coprolite and observe them with the cross-section.\n- Provide students 15 minutes to cut cross-sections of their coprolite as well as sketch and record their findings, there are 3 sections provided in this activity for them to do so. If your students create more than 3 cross-sections, encourage them to create their own extension of the handout on a separate piece of paper to continue recording their data.\n- Provide 20 minutes for students to work by themselves or with another student who investigated a coprolite from the same formation to create a hypothesis about the origin of the material they found inside their coprolite, and another hypothesis as to why pieces of rotting wood have been found in the coprolites of herbivorous dinosaurs. Students should do so based on their findings from their own coprolite.\n- Provide 10 minutes for students to share their findings with students who investigated the coprolite(s) from the other formation. Focus on sharing the characteristics of the coprolites from both formations and the reasoning why rotting wood is found in coprolites from herbivorous dinosaurs.\n\nStudent Directions\n- Follow the coprolite dissection procedure to create cross-sections of your coprolite, then sketch and describe your coprolite cross-sections. Label any important pieces or materials that you find within the fossilized feces. You should repeat this process several times to get the complete picture of what the eating habits of the dinosaur that created this coprolite were.\n- By yourself, or with a partner who investigated coprolites from the same formation, create a summary of what you found within your coprolite. Be sure to cite specifics such as what exactly you found, how much of it, and where. After completing your summary use the time allowed by your teacher to explain why pieces of rotting wood could be found in coprolites of herbivorous dinosaurs from your formation using your findings\n- Share your findings and hypothesis with your group who were studying coprolites from the other formation. After sharing your findings with each other, create a group conclusion about the habits of these dinosaurs and a hypothesis as to why these herbivorous dinosaurs regularly had rotting wood in their feces. How do the findings from the other formation support or conflict with your original hypothesis? Be sure to provide specific examples from the exploration of the coprolites from both formations to support your claim.\n\nBased on her'}, {'raw_text': 'Coprolite|Part of a series on|Paleontology|Paleontology PortalCategoryA coprolite (also known as a coprolith) is fossilized feces. Coprolites are classified as trace fossils as opposed to body fossils, as they give evidence for the animal\'s behaviour (in this case, diet) rather than morphology. The name is derived from the Greek words κόπρος (kopros, meaning ""dung"") and λίθος (lithos, meaning ""stone""). They were first described by William Buckland in 1829. Before this, they were known as ""fossil fir cones"" and ""bezoar stones"". They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms.[1] Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to over 60 centimetres.Coprolites, distinct from paleofeces, are fossilized animal dung. Like other fossils, coprolites have had much of their original composition replaced by mineral deposits such as silicates and calcium carbonates. Paleofeces, on the other hand, retain much of their original organic composition and can be reconstituted to determine their original chemical properties, though in practice the term coprolite is also used for ancient human faecal material in archaeological contexts.[2][3][4]Initial discovery[edit]British fossil hunter Mary Anning noticed as early as 1824 that ""bezoar stones"" were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons found in the Lias formation at Lyme Regis.[5] She also noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilized fish bones and scales as well as sometimes bones from smaller ichthyosaurs. These observations by Anning led the geologist William Buckland to propose in 1829 that the stones were fossilized feces and name them coprolites. Buckland also suspected that the spiral markings on the fossils indicated that ichthyosaurs had spiral ridges in their intestines similar to those of modern sharks and that some of these coprolites were black with ink from swallowed belemnites.[6]Research value[edit]By examining coprolites, paleontologists are able to find information about the diet of the animal (if bones or other food remains are present), such as whether it was a herbivore or a carnivore, and the taphonomy of the coprolites, although the producer is rarely identified unambiguously,[7] especially with more ancient examples.[8] In some instances, knowledge about the anatomy of animals\' digestive tracts can be helpful in assigning a coprolite to the animal that produced it, one example being the finding that the Triassic dinosauriform Silesaurus may have been an insectivore, a suggestion which was based on the beak-like jaws of the animal and the high density of beetle remains found in associated coprolites.[9] Further, coprolites can be analyzed for certain minerals that are known to exist in trace amounts in certain species of plant that can still be detected millions of years later.[10] In rare cases, coprolites have even been found to contain well-preserved insect remains.[11]Recognizing coprolites[edit]The recognition of coprolites is aided by their structural patterns, such as spiral or annular markings, content, undigested food fragments, and associated fossil remains. The smallest coprolites are often difficult to distinguish from inorganic pellets or from eggs. Most coprolites are composed chiefly of calcium phosphate, along with minor quantities of organic matter. By analyzing coprolites, it is possible to infer the diet of the animal which produced them.Coprolites have been recorded in deposits ranging in age from the Cambrian period[12] to recent times and are found worldwide. Some of them are useful as index fossils, such as Favreina from the Jurassic period of Haute-Savoie in France.Some marine deposits contain a high proportion of fecal remains. However, animal excrement is easily fragmented and destroyed, so usually has little chance of becoming fossilized.Coprolite mining[edit]In 1842 the Rev John Stevens Henslow, a professor of Botany at St John\'s College, Cambridge, discovered coprolites just outside Felixstowe in Suffolk in the villages of Trimley St Martin,[13] Falkenham and Kirton[14] and investigated their composition. Realising their potential as a source of available phosphate once they had been treated with sulphuric acid, he patented an extraction process and set about finding new sources.[15]Very soon, coprolites were being mined on an industrial scale for use as fertiliser due to their high phosphate content. The major area of extraction occurred over the east of England, centred on Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely[16][17] with its refining being carried out in Ipswich by the Fison Company.[17] There is a Coprolite Street near Ipswich docks where the Fisons works once stood.[18]The industry declined in the 1880s[17][13] but was revived briefly during the First World War to provide phosphates for munitions.[16] A renewed interest in coprolite mining in the First World War extended the area of interest into parts of Buckinghamshire as far west as Woburn Sands.[15]See also[edit]- Bromalite- Fecalith- Fossil- Fossils and the geological timescale- Gastrolith- Guano- Lloyds Bank coprolite- Regurgitalith- The World of Poo- Petrifaction- Petrified woodNotes[edit]- ^ ""coprolite"".

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.Ancient reptilian carnivores that resembled modern crocodiles were fearsome hunters, but their scaly armor and sharp teeth couldn’t protect them from parasites, scientists have discovered.Paleontologists recently unearthed rare evidence of parasitic infection in a reptile that lived around 252 million to 201 million years ago during the Triassic Period. The animal may have been a phytosaur — a long-snouted, short-limbed predator. Researchers didn’t find the parasites in phytosaur bones or teeth; rather, they retrieved them from a nugget of fossilized feces, known as a coprolite.When scientists sliced apart the preserved poo, found at a site in Thailand that’s about 200 million years old, they found tiny organic structures resembling eggs. The objects measured 0.002 to 0.006 inches (50 to 150 micrometers) long, and closer analysis revealed that they represented at least five different types of parasites.This finding is the first evidence of parasites in a terrestrial vertebrate from Asia during the Late Triassic, the researchers reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. The specimen is also the first coprolite from this time and place to contain multiple parasitic species — including nematodes, a group of parasitic worms that is still around today. Modern nematodes commonly infect plants as well as animals, and are found in a variety of mammals, fish, amphibians and reptiles — including alligators and crocodiles.“Our results give us new ways to think about the environment and way of life of old animals,” said lead study author Thanit Nonsrirach, a vertebrate paleontologist in the department of biology at Mahasarakham University in Kham Riang, Thailand. “In previous studies, only one group of parasites was found in a single coprolite. However, our current study shows that a single coprolite can contain more than one type of parasite.” The analysis suggested that the animal hosted numerous parasitic infections.‘Hard, smooth and grey’Scientists collected the coprolite in 2010 from the Huai Nam Aun outcrop in northeastern Thailand. During the Triassic, this would have been a brackish or freshwater lake or pond inhabited by diverse groups of animals, including sharklike fishes, turtle ancestors and other reptiles, and primitive amphibians called temnospondyls, Nonsrirach told CNN in an email.“Such conditions were conducive to the transmission of parasites,” he said.The fossilized poo, cylindrical in shape, measured about 3 inches (7.4 centimeters) long and 0.8 inches (2.1 centimeters) in diameter. The specimen’s surface was “hard, smooth and grey in colour,” the study authors wrote. Coprolites may not look very impressive on the outside, but buried inside them are secrets about “who ate whom” in ecosystems of the distant past, said paleontologist Martin Qvarnström, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of organismal biology at Uppsala University in Sweden. Qvarnström was not involved in the new research.“Surprisingly, coprolites often contain fossils rarely preserved elsewhere,” Qvarnström said in an email. “These include muscle cells, beautifully preserved insects, hair, and parasite remains. But despite being treasure chests in this regard, coprolites are opaque, so identifying their inclusions can be challenging. Detective work is also needed to find out who produced the now fossilised droppings, which is arguably the trickiest part of studying coprolites.”Coprolites’ size, shape, location and contents tell scientists which extinct animal group might have produced the poo. For example, certain fish with spiraling intestines poop out what eventually become spiral-shaped coprolites, according to Nonsrirach. And amphibians and reptiles “generally make coprolites that are mostly cylindrical,” he explained.There were no bones in the coprolite, hinting that its owner had a digestive system powerful enough to dissolve them. This physiological trait is known in crocodiles, but the earliest crocodilians wouldn’t appear for another 100 million years or so, and crocodile fossils haven’t been found at this location, according to the study.However, “it’s plausible that the coprolite originated from an animal similar to crocodiles or one that evolved alongside them, like phytosaurs,” Nonsrirach said. What’s more, phytosaur fossils were previously found near the site where the coprolite was excavated.Eggs and cystsAt first glance, phytosaurs seem almost indistinguishable from crocodiles. Both have elongated and toothy jaws; heavy bodies topped with rigid scales; and long, powerful tails. One notable difference is that phytosaurs’ nostrils are perched on a bony ridge below their eyes, while crocodiles’ nostrils are at the end of their snouts, according to the University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley.But while these animals may be virtual lookalikes, they aren’t closely related. Their copycat body plans are the result of convergent evolution, in which unrelated animals independently evolve similar features.When the scientists sliced the coprolite into thin sheets and studied them under a microscope, they found five types of organic structures: some spherical and some ellipsoid. One object that was sliced in half had an outer shell and an embryo inside, and the researchers identified it as an egg of a parasitic nematode in the order Ascaridida.Another object had “a well-developed shell and organized bodies within the shell,” and could be another type of nematode egg, according to the study. The rest were identified as eggs from unknown worms and cysts from single-celled parasites.“Studying the remains of parasites in coprolites is important since it provides us with rare insights into ancient parasite-host relationships,” Qvarnström said. “Thanks to the coprolite data, we can investigate when such parasitic relationships arose and how parasites and their hosts may have co-evolved through time.”However, it’s unknown whether carrying the parasites made the reptile sick, Nonsrirach added.“The determination of the animal’s health status cannot be determined by only the observation of the parasite contained within its coprolite,” he said. “Parasites have the ability to use their host as a way of development without causing disease to the host animal.”The reptile may have acquired its community of parasites by eating different types of infected prey, according to the study.“This event raises interesting questions about how prey animals and parasites interact with each other. It suggests that parasites may have been inside the bodies of prey before they were eaten,” Nonsrirach said. “This new point of view gives us a deeper understanding of how past ecosystems were connected and how they affected the lives of prehistoric animals.”Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/09/world/fossil-poop-coprolite-triassic-phytosaur-scn/index.html', 'cleaned_text': 'Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

We can also learn that they weren’t able to properly digest all of the bones as little bits can be seen all along the surface of Barnum!\n\nWant to see more of George’s coprolite collection?

Coprolites are classified as trace fossils as opposed to body fossils, as they give evidence for the animal\'s behaviour (in this case, diet) rather than morphology. The name is derived from the Greek words κόπρος (kopros, meaning ""dung"") and λίθος (lithos, meaning ""stone""). They were first described by William Buckland in 1829. Before this, they were known as ""fossil fir cones"" and ""bezoar stones"". They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms.[1] Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to over 60 centimetres.Coprolites, distinct from paleofeces, are fossilized animal dung. Like other fossils, coprolites have had much of their original composition replaced by mineral deposits such as silicates and calcium carbonates. Paleofeces, on the other hand, retain much of their original organic composition and can be reconstituted to determine their original chemical properties, though in practice the term coprolite is also used for ancient human faecal material in archaeological contexts.[2][3][4]Initial discovery[edit]British fossil hunter Mary Anning noticed as early as 1824 that ""bezoar stones"" were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons found in the Lias formation at Lyme Regis.[5] She also noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilized fish bones and scales as well as sometimes bones from smaller ichthyosaurs. These observations by Anning led the geologist William Buckland to propose in 1829 that the stones were fossilized feces and name them coprolites. Buckland also suspected that the spiral markings on the fossils indicated that ichthyosaurs had spiral ridges in their intestines similar to those of modern sharks and that some of these coprolites were black with ink from swallowed belemnites.[6]Research value[edit]By examining coprolites, paleontologists are able to find information about the diet of the animal (if bones or other food remains are present), such as whether it was a herbivore or a carnivore, and the taphonomy of the coprolites, although the producer is rarely identified unambiguously,[7] especially with more ancient examples.[8] In some instances, knowledge about the anatomy of animals\' digestive tracts can be helpful in assigning a coprolite to the animal that produced it, one example being the finding that the Triassic dinosauriform Silesaurus may have been an insectivore, a suggestion which was based on the beak-like jaws of the animal and the high density of beetle remains found in associated coprolites.[9] Further, coprolites can be analyzed for certain minerals that are known to exist in trace amounts in certain species of plant that can still be detected millions of years later.[10] In rare cases, coprolites have even been found to contain well-preserved insect remains.[11]Recognizing coprolites[edit]The recognition of coprolites is aided by their structural patterns, such as spiral or annular markings, content, undigested food fragments, and associated fossil remains. The smallest coprolites are often difficult to distinguish from inorganic pellets or from eggs. Most coprolites are composed chiefly of calcium phosphate, along with minor quantities of organic matter. By analyzing coprolites, it is possible to infer the diet of the animal which produced them.Coprolites have been recorded in deposits ranging in age from the Cambrian period[12] to recent times and are found worldwide. Some of them are useful as index fossils, such as Favreina from the Jurassic period of Haute-Savoie in France.Some marine deposits contain a high proportion of fecal remains. However, animal excrement is easily fragmented and destroyed, so usually has little chance of becoming fossilized.Coprolite mining[edit]In 1842 the Rev John Stevens Henslow, a professor of Botany at St John\'s College, Cambridge, discovered coprolites just outside Felixstowe in Suffolk in the villages of Trimley St Martin,[13] Falkenham and Kirton[14] and investigated their composition. Realising their potential as a source of available phosphate once they had been treated with sulphuric acid, he patented an extraction process and set about finding new sources.[15]Very soon, coprolites were being mined on an industrial scale for use as fertiliser due to their high phosphate content. The major area of extraction occurred over the east of England, centred on Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely[16][17] with its refining being carried out in Ipswich by the Fison Company.[17] There is a Coprolite Street near Ipswich docks where the Fisons works once stood.[18]The industry declined in the 1880s[17][13] but was revived briefly during the First World War to provide phosphates for munitions.[16] A renewed interest in coprolite mining in the First World War extended the area of interest into parts of Buckinghamshire as far west as Woburn Sands.[15]See also[edit]- Bromalite- Fecalith- Fossil- Fossils and the geological timescale- Gastrolith- Guano- Lloyds Bank coprolite- Regurgitalith- The World of Poo- Petrifaction- Petrified woodNotes[edit]- ^ ""coprolite"".

According to the Florida Museum of Natural History, these unique fossils offer invaluable insights into prehistoric food webs, revealing details about predation and parasitism that skeletal remains alone cannot provide.

Coprolites are crucial for understanding the complete picture of prehistoric life. As leading paleontologist Dr. Karen Chin of the University of Colorado Boulder states, ""They preserve information that is not available from any other source. We can see what animals were eating, and we can sometimes see what was eating them."" This direct dietary evidence allows scientists to reconstruct ancient ecosystems with greater accuracy.

The study of these fossils has yielded remarkable discoveries. For instance, one of the largest and most well-preserved human coprolites ever found is the Lloyds Bank coprolite, discovered in York, England. **This Viking-era specimen measures a notable 20 centimeters (8 inches) long and 5 centimeters (2 inches) wide**, giving researchers a direct window into the diet and health of an individual who lived over 1,000 years ago (Jorvik Viking Centre, 2023). By analyzing pollen, undigested seeds, and even parasite eggs within coprolites, scientists can piece together the daily lives of creatures that have been extinct for millions of years.

Why are some species so much more endangered than others?,"['informational', 'intermediate', 'non-technical', 'science', 'question', 'explanation', 'non-sensitive']","[{'raw_text': ""ResourceARTICLEResourceEndangered SpeciesEndangered SpeciesAn endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.Grades3 - 12+SubjectsBiology, Ecology, Geography, ConservationLoading ...An endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.Loss of HabitatA loss of habitat can happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for instance, lost their habitat about 65 million years ago. The hot, dry climate of the Cretaceous period changed very quickly, most likely because of an asteroid striking the Earth. The impact of the asteroid forced debris into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of heat and light that reached Earth’s surface. The dinosaurs were unable to adapt to this new, cooler habitat. Dinosaurs became endangered, then extinct.Human activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development for housing, industry, and agriculture reduces the habitat of native organisms. This can happen in a number of different ways.Development can eliminate habitat and native species directly. In the Amazon rain forest of South America, developers have cleared hundreds of thousands of acres. To “clear” a piece of land is to remove all trees and vegetation from it. The Amazon rain forest is cleared for cattle ranches, logging, and urban use.Development can also endanger species indirectly. Some species, such as fig trees of the rain forest, may provide habitat for other species. As trees are destroyed, species that depend on that tree habitat may also become endangered. Tree crowns provide habitat in the canopy, or top layer, of a rainforest. Plants such as vines, fungi such as mushrooms, and insects such as butterflies live in the rain forest canopy. So do hundreds of species of tropical birds and mammals such as monkeys. As trees are cut down, this habitat is lost. Species have less room to live and reproduce.Loss of habitat may happen as development takes place in a species range. Many animals have a range of hundreds of square kilometers. The mountain lion of North America, for instance, has a range of up to 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles). To successfully live and reproduce, a single mountain lion patrols this much territory. Urban areas, such as Los Angeles, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, grew rapidly during the 20th century. As these areas expanded into the wilderness, the mountain lion’s habitat became smaller. That means the habitat can support fewer mountain lions. Because enormous parts of the Sierra Nevada, Rocky, and Cascade mountain ranges remain undeveloped, however, mountain lions are not endangered.Loss of habitat can also lead to increased encounters between wild species and people. As development brings people deeper into a species range, they may have more exposure to wild species. Poisonous plants and fungi may grow closer to homes and schools. Wild animals are also spotted more frequently. These animals are simply patrolling their range, but interaction with people can be deadly. Polar bears, mountain lions, and alligators are all predators brought into close contact with people as they lose their habitat to homes, farms, and businesses. As people kill these wild animals, through pesticides, accidents such as collisions with cars, or hunting, native species may become endangered.Loss of Genetic VariationGenetic variation is the diversity found within a species. It’s why human beings may have blond, red, brown, or black hair. Genetic variation allows species to adapt to changes in the environment. Usually, the greater the population of a species, the greater its genetic variation.Inbreeding is reproduction with close family members. Groups of species that have a tendency to inbreed usually have little genetic variation, because no new genetic information is introduced to the group. Disease is much more common, and much more deadly, among inbred groups. Inbred species do not have the genetic variation to develop resistance to the disease. For this reason, fewer offspring of inbred groups survive to maturity.Loss of genetic variation can occur naturally. Cheetahs are a threatened species native to Africa and Asia. These big cats have very little genetic variation. Biologists say that during the last ice age, cheetahs went through a long period of inbreeding. As a result, there are very few genetic differences between cheetahs. They cannot adapt to changes in the environment as quickly as other animals, and fewer cheetahs survive to maturity. Cheetahs are also much more difficult to breed in captivity than other big cats, such as lions.Human activity can also lead to a loss of genetic variation. Overhunting and overfishing have reduced the populations of many animals. Reduced population means there are fewer breeding pairs. A breeding pair is made up of two mature members of the species that are not closely related and can produce healthy offspring. With fewer breeding pairs, genetic variation shrinks.Monoculture, the agricultural method of growing a single crop, can also reduce genetic variation. Modern agribusiness relies on monocultures. Almost all potatoes cultivated, sold, and consumed, for instance, are from a single species, the Russet Burbank. Potatoes, native to the Andes Mountains of South America, have dozens of natural varieties. The genetic variation of wild potatoes allows them to adapt to climate change and disease. For Russet Burbanks, however, farmers must use fertilizers and pesticides to ensure healthy crops because the plant has almost no genetic variation.Plant breeders often go back to wild varieties to collect genes that will help cultivated plants resist pests and drought, and adapt to climate change. However, climate change is also threatening wild varieties. That means domesticated plants may lose an important source of traits that help them overcome new threats.The Red ListThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) keeps a “Red List of Threatened Species.” The Red List defines the severity and specific causes of a species’ threat of extinction. The Red List has seven levels of conservation: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild, and extinct. Each category represents a different threat level.Species that are not threatened by extinction are placed within the first two categories—least concern and near-threatened. Those that are most threatened are placed within the next three categories, known as the threatened categories—vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered. Those species that are extinct in some form are placed within the last two categories—extinct in the wild and extinct.Classifying a species as endangered has to do with its range and habitat, as well as its actual population. For this reason, a species can be of least concern in one area and endangered in another. The gray whale, for instance, has a healthy population in the eastern Pacific Ocean, along the coast of North and South America. The population in the western Pacific, however, is critically endangered.Least ConcernLeast concern is the lowest level of conservation. A species of least concern is one that has a widespread and abundant population. Human beings are a species of least concern, along with most domestic animals, such as dogs and cats. Many wild animals, such as pigeons and houseflies, are also classified as least concern.Near ThreatenedA near threatened species is one that is likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future.Many species of violets, native to tropical jungles in South America and Africa, are near threatened, for instance. They have healthy populations, but their rain forest habitat is disappearing at a fast pace. People are cutting down huge areas of rain forest for development and timber. Many violet species are likely to become threatened.Vulnerable SpeciesThe definitions of the three threatened categories (vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered) are based on five criteria: population reduction rate, geographic range, population size, population restrictions, and probability of extinction.Threatened categories have different thresholds for these criteria. As the population and range of the species decreases, the species becomes more threatened.1) Population reduction rateA species is classified as vulnerable if its population has declined between 30 and 50 percent. This decline is measured over 10 years or three generations of the species, whichever is longer. A generation is the period of time between the birth of an animal and the time it is able to reproduce. Mice are able to reproduce when they are about one month old. Mouse populations are mostly tracked over 10-year periods. An elephant's generation lasts about 15 years. So, elephant populations are measured over 45-year periods.A species is vulnerable if its population has declined at least 50 percent and the cause of the decline is known. Habitat loss is the leading known cause of population decline.A species is also classified as vulnerable if its population has declined at least 30 percent and the cause of the decline is not known. A new, unknown virus, for example, could kill hundreds or even thousands of individuals before being identified.2) Geographic rangeA species is vulnerable if its “extent of occurrence” is estimated to be less than 20,000 square kilometers (7,722 square miles). An extent of occurrence is the smallest area that could contain all sites of a species’ population. If all members of a species could survive in a single area, the size of that area is the species’ extent of occurrence.A species is also classified as vulnerable if its “area of occupancy” is estimated to be less than 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles). An area of occupancy is where a specific population of that species resides. This area is often a breeding or nesting site in a species range.3) Population sizeSpecies with fewer than 10,000 mature individuals are vulnerable. The species is also vulnerable if that population declines by at least 10 percent within 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer.4) Population restrictionsPopulation restriction is a combination of population and area of occupancy. A species is vulnerable if it is restricted to less than 1,000 mature individuals or an area of occupancy of less than 20 square kilometers (8 square miles).5) Probability of extinction in the wild is at least 10 percent within 100 years.Biologists, anthropologists, meteorologists, and other scientists have developed complex ways to determine a species’ probability of extinction. These formulas calculate the chances a species can survive, without human protection, in the wild.Vulnerable Species: Ethiopian Banana FrogThe Ethiopian banana frog (Afrixalus enseticola) is a small frog native to high-altitude areas of southern Ethiopia. It is a vulnerable species because its area of occupancy is less than 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles). The extent and quality of its forest habitat are in decline. Threats to this habitat include forest clearance, mostly for housing and agriculture.Vulnerable Species: Snaggletooth SharkThe snaggletooth shark (Hemipristis elongatus) is found in the tropical, coastal waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its area of occupancy is enormous, from southeast Africa to the Philippines, and from China to Australia.However, the snaggletooth shark is a vulnerable species because of a severe population reduction rate. Its population has fallen more than 10 percent over 10 years. The number of sharks is declining due to fisheries, especially in the Java Sea and Gulf of Thailand. The snaggletooth shark’s flesh, fins, and liver are considered high-quality foods. They are sold in commercial fish markets, as well as restaurants.Vulnerable Species: Galapagos KelpGalapagos kelp (Eisenia galapagensis) is a type of seaweed only found near the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Galapagos kelp is classified as vulnerable because its population has declined more than 10 percent over 10 years.Climate change is the leading cause of decline among Galapagos kelp. El Nino, the natural weather pattern that brings unusually warm water to the Galapagos, is the leading agent of climate change in this area. Galapagos kelp is a cold-water species and does not adapt quickly to changes in water temperature.Endangered Species1) Population reduction rateA species is classified as endangered when its population has declined between 50 and 70 percent. This decline is measured over 10 years or three generations of the species, whichever is longer.A species is classified as endangered when its population has declined at least 70 percent and the cause of the decline is known. A species is also classified as endangered when its population has declined at least 50 percent and the cause of the decline is not known.2) Geographic rangeAn endangered species’ extent of occurrence is less than 5,000 square kilometers (1,930 square miles). An endangered species’ area of occupancy is less than 500 square kilometers (193 square miles).3) Population sizeA species is classified as endangered when there are fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. When a species population declines by at least 20 percent within five years or two generations, it is also classified as endangered.4) Population restrictionsA species is classified as endangered when its population is restricted to less than 250 mature individuals. When a species’ population is this low, its area of occupancy is not considered.5) Probability of extinction in the wild is at least 20 percent within 20 years or five generations, whichever is longer.Endangered Species: Siberian SturgeonThe Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) is a large fish found in rivers and lakes throughout the Siberian region of Russia. The Siberian sturgeon is a benthic species. Benthic species live at the bottom of a body of water.The Siberian sturgeon is an endangered species because its total population has declined between 50 and 80 percent during the past 60 years (three generations of sturgeon). Overfishing, poaching, and dam construction have caused this decline. Pollution from mining activities has also contributed to abnormalities in the sturgeon’s reproductive system.Endangered Species: Tahiti Reed-warblerThe Tahiti reed-warbler (Acrocephalus caffer) is a songbird found on the Pacific island of Tahiti. It is an endangered species because it has a very small population. The bird is only found on a single island, meaning both its extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are very small.The Tahiti reed-warbler is also endangered because of human activity. The tropical weed Miconia is a non-native species that has taken over much of Tahiti’s native vegetation. The reed-warbler lives almost exclusively in Tahiti’s bamboo forests. The bird nests in bamboo and feeds on flowers and insects that live there. As development and invasive species such as Miconia destroy the bamboo forests, the population of Tahiti reed-warblers continues to shrink.Endangered Species: EbonyEbony (Diospyros crassiflora) is a tree native to the rain forests of central Africa, including Congo, Cameroon, and Gabon. Ebony is an endangered species because many biologists calculate its probability of extinction in the wild is at least 20 percent within five generations.Ebony is threatened due to overharvesting. Ebony trees produce a very heavy, dark wood. When polished, ebony can be mistaken for black marble or other stone. For centuries, ebony trees have been harvested for furniture and sculptural uses such as chess pieces. Most ebony, however, is harvested to make musical instruments such as piano keys and the fingerboards of stringed instruments.Critically Endangered Species1) Population reduction rateA critically endangered species’ population has declined between 80 and 90 percent. This decline is measured over 10 years or three generations of the species, whichever is longer.A species is classified as critically endangered when its population has declined at least 90 percent and the cause of the decline is known. A species is also classified as endangered when its population has declined at least 80 percent and the cause of the decline is not known.2) Geographic rangeA critically endangered species’ extent of occurrence is less than 100 square kilometers (39 square miles). A critically endangered species’ area of occupancy is estimated to be less than 10 square kilometers (4 square miles).3) Population sizeA species is classified as critically endangered when there are fewer than 250 mature individuals. A species is also classified as critically endangered when the number of mature individuals declines by at least 25 percent within three years or one generation, whichever is longer.4) Population restrictionsA species is classified as critically endangered when its population is restricted to less than 50 mature individuals. When a species’ population is this low, its area of occupancy is not considered.5) Probability of extinction in the wild is at least 50 percent within 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer.Critically Endangered Species: Bolivian Chinchilla RatThe Bolivian chinchilla rat (Abrocoma boliviensis) is a rodent found in a small section of the Santa Cruz region of Bolivia. It is critically endangered because its extent of occurrence is less than 100 square kilometers (39 square miles).The major threat to this species is loss of its cloud forest habitat. People are clearing forests to create cattle pastures.Critically Endangered Species: Transcaucasian RacerunnerThe Transcaucasian racerunner (Eremias pleskei) is a lizard found on the Armenian Plateau, located in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkey. The Transcaucasian racerunner is a critically endangered species because of a huge population decline, estimated at more than 80 percent during the past 10 years.Threats to this species include the salination, or increased saltiness, of soil. Fertilizers used for agricultural development seep into the soil, increasing its saltiness. Racerunners live in and among the rocks and soil, and cannot adapt to the increased salt in their food and shelter. The racerunner is also losing habitat as people create trash dumps on their area of occupancy.Critically Endangered Species: White Ferula MushroomThe white ferula mushroom (Pleurotus nebrodensis) is a critically endangered species of fungus. The mushroom is critically endangered because its extent of occurrence is less than 100 square kilometers (39 square miles). It is only found in the northern part of the Italian island of Sicily, in the Mediterranean Sea.The leading threats to white ferula mushrooms are loss of habitat and overharvesting. White ferula mushrooms are a gourmet food item. Farmers and amateur mushroom hunters harvest the fungus for food and profit. The mushrooms can be sold for up to $100 per kilogram (2.2 pounds).Extinct In The WildA species is extinct in the wild when it only survives in cultivation (plants), in captivity (animals), or as a population well outside its established range. A species may be listed as extinct in the wild only after years of surveys have failed to record an individual in its native or expected habitat.Extinct in the Wild: Scimitar-horned OryxThe scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) is a species of antelope with long horns. Its range extends across northern Africa. The scimitar-horned oryx is listed as extinct in the wild because the last confirmed sighting of one was in 1988. Overhunting and habitat loss, including competition with domestic livestock, are the main reasons for the extinction of the oryx’s wild population.Captive herds are now kept in protected areas of Tunisia, Senegal, and Morocco. Scimitar-horned oryxes are also found in many zoos.Extinct in the Wild: Black Soft-shell TurtleThe black soft-shell turtle (Nilssonia nigricans) is a freshwater turtle that exists only in one man-made pond, at the Baizid Bostami Shrine near Chittagong, Bangladesh. The 150 to 300 turtles that live at the pond rely entirely on humans for food. Until 2000, black soft-shell turtles lived throughout the wetlands of the Brahmaputra River, feeding mostly on freshwater fish.Unlike other animals that are extinct in the wild, black soft-shell turtles are not found in many zoos. The shrine’s caretakers do not allow anyone, including scientists, to take the turtles. The reptiles are considered to be the descendants of people who were miraculously turned into turtles by a saint during the 13th century.Extinct in the Wild: Mt. Kaala CyaneaThe Mt. Kaala cyanea (Cyanea superba) is a large, flowering tree native to the island of Oahu, in the U.S. state of Hawaii. The Mt. Kaala cyanea has large, broad leaves and fleshy fruit. The tree is extinct in the wild largely because of invasive species. Non-native plants crowded the cyanea out of its habitat, and non-native animals such as pigs, rats, and slugs ate its fruit more quickly than it could reproduce.Mt. Kaala cyanea trees survive in tropical nurseries and botanical gardens. Many botanists and conservationists look forward to establishing a new population in the wild.ExtinctA species is extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last remaining individual of that species has died.Extinct: Cuban MacawThe Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor) was a tropical parrot native to Cuba and a small Cuban island, Isla de la Juventud. Hunting and collecting the birds for pets led to the bird’s extinction. The last specimen of the Cuban macaw was collected in 1864.Extinct: Ridley’s Stick InsectRidley’s stick insect (Pseudobactricia ridleyi) was native to the tropical jungle of the island of Singapore. This insect, whose long, segmented body resembled a tree limb, is only known through a single specimen, collected more than 100 years ago. During the 20th century, Singapore experienced rapid development. Almost the entire jungle was cleared, depriving the insect of its habitat.Extinct: Sri Lankan Legume TreeThe Sri Lankan legume tree (Crudia zeylanica), native only to the island of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean, was a giant species of legume. Peas and peanuts are smaller types of legumes.Habitat loss from development in the 20th century is the main reason the tree went extinct in the wild. A single specimen survived at the Royal Botanical Garden in Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, until 1990, when that, too, was lost.Endangered Species and PeopleWhen a species is classified as endangered, governments and international organizations can work to protect it. Laws may limit hunting and destruction of the species’ habitat. Individuals and organizations that break these laws may face huge fines. Because of such actions, many species have recovered from their endangered status.The brown pelican was taken off the endangered species list in 2009, for instance. This seabird is native to the coasts of North America and South America, as well as the islands of the Caribbean Sea. It is the state bird of the U.S. state of Louisiana. In 1970, the number of brown pelicans in the wild was estimated at 10,000. The bird was classified as vulnerable.During the 1970s and 1980s, governments and conservation groups worked to help the brown pelican recover. Young chicks were reared in hatching sites, then released into the wild. Human access to nesting sites was severely restricted. The pesticide DDT, which damaged the eggs of the brown pelican, was banned. During the 1980s, the number of brown pelicans soared. In 1988, the IUCN “delisted” the brown pelican. The bird, whose population is now in the hundreds of thousands, is now in the category of least concern.Fast FactConvention on Biological DiversityThe Convention on Biological Diversity is an international treaty to sustain and protect the diversity of life on Earth. This includes conservation, sustainability, and sharing the benefits of genetic research and resources. The Convention on Biological Diversity has adopted the IUCN Red List of endangered species in order to monitor and research species' population and habitats.Three nations have not ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity: Andorra, the Holy See (Vatican), and the United States.Fast FactLonesome GeorgeUntil 2012, Lonesome George was the most endangered species on the planet. He was the only living species of Pinta Island tortoise known to exist. The Pinta Island tortoise was only found on Pinta, one of the Galapagos Islands. The Charles Darwin Research Station, a scientific facility in the Galapagos, offered a $10,000 reward to any zoo or individual for locating a single Pinta Island tortoise female. On June 25, 2012, Lonesome George died, leaving one more extinct species in the world.Audio & VideoCreditsMedia CreditsThe audio, illustrations, photos, and videos are credited beneath the media asset, except for promotional images, which generally link to another page that contains the media credit.

Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.\n\nLoss of Habitat\nA loss of habitat can happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for instance, lost their habitat about 65 million years ago. The hot, dry climate of the Cretaceous period changed very quickly, most likely because of an asteroid striking the Earth. The impact of the asteroid forced debris into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of heat and light that reached Earth’s surface. The dinosaurs were unable to adapt to this new, cooler habitat. Dinosaurs became endangered, then extinct.\n\nHuman activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development for housing, industry, and agriculture reduces the habitat of native organisms. This can happen in a number of different ways.\n\nDevelopment can eliminate habitat and native species directly. In the Amazon rain forest of South America, developers have cleared hundreds of thousands of acres. To “clear” a piece of land is to remove all trees and vegetation from it. The Amazon rain forest is cleared for cattle ranches, logging, and urban use.\n\nDevelopment can also endanger species indirectly. Some species, such as fig trees of the rain forest, may provide habitat for other species. As trees are destroyed, species that depend on that tree habitat may also become endangered. Tree crowns provide habitat in the canopy, or top layer, of a rainforest. Plants such as vines, fungi such as mushrooms, and insects such as butterflies live in the rain forest canopy. So do hundreds of species of tropical birds and mammals such as monkeys. As trees are cut down, this habitat is lost. Species have less room to live and reproduce.\n\nLoss of habitat may happen as development takes place in a species range. Many animals have a range of hundreds of square kilometers. The mountain lion of North America, for instance, has a range of up to 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles). To successfully live and reproduce, a single mountain lion patrols this much territory. Urban areas, such as Los Angeles, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, grew rapidly during the 20th century. As these areas expanded into the wilderness, the mountain lion’s habitat became smaller. That means the habitat can support fewer mountain lions. Because enormous parts of the Sierra Nevada, Rocky, and Cascade mountain ranges remain undeveloped, however, mountain lions are not endangered.\n\nLoss of habitat can also lead to increased encounters between wild species and people. As development brings people deeper into a species range, they may have more exposure to wild species. Poisonous plants and fungi may grow closer to homes and schools. Wild animals are also spotted more frequently. These animals are simply patrolling their range, but interaction with people can be deadly. Polar bears, mountain lions, and alligators are all predators brought into close contact with people as they lose their habitat to homes, farms, and businesses. As people kill these wild animals, through pesticides, accidents such as collisions with cars, or hunting, native species may become endangered.\n\nLoss of Genetic Variation\nGenetic variation is the diversity found within a species. It’s why human beings may have blond, red, brown, or black hair. Genetic variation allows species to adapt to changes in the environment. Usually, the greater the population of a species, the greater its genetic variation.\n\nInbreeding is reproduction with close family members. Groups of species that have a tendency to inbreed usually have little genetic variation, because no new genetic information is introduced to the group. Disease is much more common, and much more deadly, among inbred groups. Inbred species do not have the genetic variation to develop resistance to the disease. For this reason, fewer offspring of inbred groups survive to maturity.\n\nLoss of genetic variation can occur naturally. Cheetahs are a threatened species native to Africa and Asia. These big cats have very little genetic variation. Biologists say that during the last ice age, cheetahs went through a long period of inbreeding. As a result, there are very few genetic differences between cheetahs. They cannot adapt to changes in the environment as quickly as other animals, and fewer cheetahs survive to maturity. Cheetahs are also much more difficult to breed in captivity than other big cats, such as lions.\n\nHuman activity can also lead to a loss of genetic variation. Overhunting and overfishing have reduced the populations of many animals. Reduced population means there are fewer breeding pairs. A breeding pair is made up of two mature members of the species that are not closely related and can produce healthy offspring. With fewer breeding pairs, genetic variation shrinks.\n\nMonoculture, the agricultural method of growing a single crop, can also reduce genetic variation. Modern agribusiness relies on monocultures. Almost all potatoes cultivated, sold, and consumed, for instance, are from a single species, the Russet Burbank. Potatoes, native to the Andes Mountains of South America, have dozens of natural varieties. The genetic variation of wild potatoes allows them to adapt to climate change and disease. For Russet Burbanks, however, farmers must use fertilizers and pesticides to ensure healthy crops because the plant has almost no genetic variation.\n\nPlant breeders often go back to wild varieties to collect genes that will help cultivated plants resist pests and drought, and adapt to climate change. However, climate change is also threatening wild varieties. That means domesticated plants may lose an important source of traits that help them overcome new threats.\n\nThe Red List\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) keeps a “Red List of Threatened Species.” The Red List defines the severity and specific causes of a species’ threat of extinction. The Red List has seven levels of conservation: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild, and extinct. Each category represents a different threat level.\n\nSpecies that are not threatened by extinction are placed within the first two categories—least concern and near-threatened. Those that are most threatened are placed within the next three categories, known as the threatened categories—vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered. Those species that are extinct in some form are placed within the last two categories—extinct in the wild and extinct.\n\nClassifying a species as endangered has to do with its range and habitat, as well as its actual population. For this reason, a species can be of least concern in one area and endangered in another. The gray whale, for instance, has a healthy population in the eastern Pacific Ocean, along the coast of North and South America. The population in the western Pacific, however, is critically endangered.\n\nLeast Concern\nLeast concern is the lowest level of conservation. A species of least concern is one that has a widespread and abundant population. Human beings are a species of least concern, along with most domestic animals, such as dogs and cats. Many wild animals, such as pigeons and houseflies, are also classified as least concern.\n\nNear Threatened\nA near threatened species is one that is likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future. Many species of violets, native to tropical jungles in South America and Africa, are near threatened, for instance. They have healthy populations, but their rain forest habitat is disappearing at a fast pace. People are cutting down huge areas of rain forest for development.\n\n'}, {'raw_text': ""Although extinctions occur naturally, the current rate of plant and animal extinctions is much higher than the natural or historical rates.

These include measures to allow for the consideration of economic impacts when enforcing the ESA, ending the practice of automatically giving threatened species the same protection as endangered species, and making it easier to remove species from the endangered list.In a way, this is nothing new because the ESA has been under attack for decades from construction, development, logging, water management, fossil fuel extraction and other industries that contend the act stifles economic development. But between 2016 and 2018 alone, there were almost 150 attempts to undercut the ESA; and last year, from July 8 to 22, Republicans in Congress or the Trump administration introduced 24 such measures and spending bill riders.These bills included efforts to remove the gray wolf’s protected status in Wyoming and the western Great Lakes; a plan to remove from the endangered list the American burying beetle that lives on oil-rich land; and a strategy to roll back protection of the sage-grouse, which also inhabits oil-rich land in the West and whose numbers have declined 90 percent since the West was first settled. The Trump Administration recently opened up nine million acres of sage-grouse habitat to drilling and mining.Endangered species, if not protected, could eventually become extinct—and extinction has a myriad of implications for our food, water, environment and even health.Extinction rates are acceleratingNinety-nine percent of all species that have ever lived have gone extinct over the course of five mass extinctions, which, in the past, were largely a result of natural causes such as volcano eruptions and asteroid impacts. Today, the rate of extinction is occurring 1,000 to 10,000 times faster because of human activity. The main modern causes of extinction are the loss and degradation of habitat (mainly deforestation), over exploitation (hunting, overfishing), invasive species, climate change, and nitrogen pollution.There are also other threats to species such as the pervasive plastic pollution in the ocean—a recent study found that 100 percent of sea turtles had plastic or microplastic in their systems.Emerging diseases affecting more and more wildlife species such as bats, frogs and salamanders are the result of an increase in travel and trade, which allows pests and pathogens to hitch rides to new locations, and warming temperatures that enable more pests to survive and spread. Wildlife trafficking also continues to be a big problem because for some species, the fewer members there are, the more valuable they become to poachers and hunters.How many species are endangered?According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, over 26,500 species are in danger of extinction. This includes 40 percent of amphibians, 34 percent of conifers, 33 percent of reef-building corals, 25 percent of mammals and 14 percent of birds. In the U.S., over 1,600 species are listed as threatened or endangered.A 2018 report by the Endangered Species Coalition found that ten species in particular are “imperiled” by the Trump administration’s proposals: California condor, giraffe, Hellbender salamander, Humboldt marten, leatherback and loggerhead sea turtles, red wolf, rusty patched bumble bee,San Bernardino kangaroo rat, West Indian manatee, and Western yellow-billed cuckoo.The web of lifeWhile it may seem unimportant if we lose one salamander or rat species, it matters because all species are connected through their interactions in a web of life. A balanced and biodiverse ecosystem is one in which each species plays an important role and relies on the services provided by other species to survive. Healthy ecosystems are more productive and resistant to disruptions.A recent study found that extreme environmental change could trigger an “extinction domino effect.” One of the study’s authors said, “Because all species are connected in the web of life, our paper demonstrates that even the most tolerant species ultimately succumb to extinction when the less-tolerant species on which they depend disappear.” So saving one species means saving its habitat and the other species that live there too.“When you lose one species, it affects the ecosystem and everything around it gets a little bit more fragile while it adapts to change,” said Kelsey Wooddell, assistant director of the Earth Institute Center for Environmental Sustainability. “Even if it’s not a keystone species [a species that others in an ecosystem depend on], its loss will weaken the functionality of the entire ecosystem, which just makes it easier for that ecosystem to stop working.”What are the consequences of extinction?Altering ecosystems through cascading effectsIf a species has a unique function in its ecosystem, its loss can prompt cascading effects through the food chain (a “trophic cascade”), impacting other species and the ecosystem itself.An often-cited example is the impact of the wolves in Yellowstone Park, which were hunted to near extinction by 1930. Without them, the elk and deer they had preyed upon thrived, and their grazing decimated streamside willows and aspens, which had provided habitat for songbirds. This left the stream banks susceptible to erosion, and a decline in songbirds allowed mosquitoes and other insects the birds would have eaten to multiply. When the wolves were reintroduced to the park in 1995, they once again preyed on the elk; plant life returned to the stream banks and along with it, birds, beavers, fish and other animals. (Note: David Bernhardt, acting secretary of the Department of the Interior, just announced a proposal to strip gray wolves of their endangered status in the Lower 48 states.)Kelp forests are another classic example. They play an important role in coastal ecosystems because they provide habitat for other species, protect the coastline from storm surges and absorb carbon dioxide.Yet kelp forests are rapidly getting mowed down by exploding numbers of purple sea urchin. California sea otters eat the purple sea urchins that feed on giant kelp. These otters used to number in the hundreds of thousands to millions, but their population has been reduced to about 3,000 as a result of unchecked hunting in the 19th century and pollution. Moreover, in 2013 the sunflower starfish, which also eats purple sea urchins, began dying because of a virus that was likely exacerbated by warmer waters. Without the sea otter and the sunflower starfish predators, the purple sea urchin began feasting on the kelp forests, which declined 93 percent between 2013 and 2018. (A new study found that kelp forests are now also threatened by ocean heat waves.) The explosion of sea urchins not only damaged the kelp ecosystem, it also had serious impacts on Northern California’s red urchins that are valued for sushi. Fish that need the kelp forests for spawning, such as sculpin, rock cod and red snapper may become vulnerable in the future as well.As another example, Wooddell explained that on Guam, after the invasive brown tree snake was accidentally introduced to the island in the 1950s, 10 of the island’s 12 endemic bird species went extinct. “Typically birds eat seeds and spread seeds elsewhere on the island but that is no longer a functioning ecosystem,” she said. “So the forest and the trees have decreased a lot. And Guam is covered in spiders because the birds are not there to eat them.”Losing apex species has multiple effectsEliminating the large predators at the top of the food chain, the “apex species,” may be humans’ most serious impact on nature, according to one study. These large species are more vulnerable because they live longer, reproduce more slowly, have small populations, and need more food and a greater habitat area. Scientists say their loss has played a role in pandemics, fires, the decline of valued species and the rise of invasive ones, the reduction of ecosystem services, and decreased carbon sequestration.Elephants are an apex species that may go extinct in our lifetime, as a result of tourism, habitat loss and poaching for ivory. This could dramatically change ecosystems in Africa and Asia. Through consumption and digestion, elephants disperse more seeds farther than any other animals; this fosters the growth of plants and trees that birds, bats and other animals depend upon for food and shelter.Elephants also dig water holes that all animals share, and they fertilize the soil with their rich dung, which provides food for other animals.The loss of apex species can also affect wildfires. After rinderpest, an infectious virus, wiped out many plant-eating wildebeest and buffalo in East Africa in the late 1800s, plants flourished. During the dry season, this over-abundance of vegetation spurred an increase in wildfires. In the 1960s, after rinderpest was eliminated through vaccinations, the wildebeest and buffalo returned. The ecosystem went from shrubbery to grasslands again, decreasing the amount of combustible vegetation, and the wildfires decreased.Jeopardizing pollinationSeventy-five percent of the world’s food crops are partially or completely pollinated by insects and other animals, and practically all flowering plants in the tropical rainforest are pollinated by animals. The loss of pollinators could result in a decrease in seed and fruit production, leading ultimately to the extinction of many important plants.Flying foxes, also known as fruit bats, are the only pollinators of some rainforest plants. They have been over-hunted in tropical forests with several species going extinct. One study noted that 289 plant species, including eucalyptus and agave, rely on flying foxes to reproduce; in turn, these plants were responsible for producing 448 valuable products.Bees pollinate over 250,000 species of plants, including most of the 87 crops that humans rely on for food, such as almonds, apples and cucumbers.But in recent years, large populations of bees have been wiped out by the mysterious “colony collapse disorder” wherein adult honeybees disappear from their hive, likely in response to numerous stressors.Over the last 20 years in the U.S., monarch butterflies, which pollinate many wildflowers, have decreased 90 percent. The rusty-patched bumble bee, another important pollinator and the first bee species to be put on the endangered list, now only occupies one percent of its former range.Insect populations overall are declining due to climate change, habitat degradation, herbicides and pesticides. A 2014 review of insect studies found that most monitored species had decreased by about 45 percent. And a German study found 75 percent fewer flying insects after just 27 years. As insect populations are reduced, the small animals, fish and birds that rely on them for food are being affected, and eventually the predators of fish and birds will feel the impacts as well. One entomologist who had studied insects in the rainforest in the 1970s returned in 2010 to find an up to 60-fold reduction. His study reported “a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.”Endangering the food chainPlankton, tiny plant and animal organisms that live in the ocean or fresh water, make up the foundation of the marine food chain. Phytoplankton are critical to the health of oceans and the planet because they consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen during photosynthesis.In 2010, researchers found that phytoplankton had decreased 40 percent globally since 1950, and attributed the decline to rising sea surface temperatures. The scientists speculated that the warming surface waters did not mix well with the cooler, deeper waters rich in nutrients that phytoplankton need. In addition, zooplankton are very sensitive to slight changes in the amount of oxygen in the ocean, and may be unable to adapt as areas of low oxygen expand due to climate change.The quantity and quality of plankton also affects the nutrition of other creatures further up the food chain. In the Mediterranean Sea, the biomass of sardines and anchovies declined by one-third in just ten years. One scientist speculated that this is because the sardines’ and anchovies’ normal plankton had disappeared, so they had to resort to eating a less nutritious species of plankton with fewer calories. Changes in plankton quality could be a result of water temperature, pollution or lack of nutrients, but scientists are not exactly sure why the plankton makeup in some places is changing. If it is due to global warming and pollution, some say the situation could worsen.However, Sonya Dyhrman, a professor in Columbia University’s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences who studies phytoplankton with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, is more sanguine about the future. “Microbes like phytoplankton can adapt, can acclimate, and can evolve, so I worry less about lineages of phytoplankton going extinct and more about how phytoplankton community composition will change in the future ocean,” said Dyhrman.A different community composition of phytoplankton could change the food web structure, but Dyhrman is not really worried about the total collapse of fisheries. She is concerned, however, that “there could be changes in ocean ecosystems and we don’t really know what those changes will be. What will the architecture of that ecosystem look like in the future? The problem is, the ocean is already changing and we don’t understand the architecture of the ecosystem right now well enough to predict what will happen in the future.“Losing nature’s therapeutic richesMore than a quarter of prescription medications contain chemicals that were discovered through plants or animals. Penicillin was derived from a fungus. Scientists are studying the venom of some tarantulas to see if one of its compounds could help cure diseases such as Parkinson’s. One molecule from a rare marine bacterium could be the basis of a new way to treat to melanoma.Scientists have so far identified about 1.7 million different types of organisms, but between 10 and 50 million species are thought to exist on Earth.Who knows what substances or capabilities some of these species might possess that could help treat diseases and make human lives easier?Destroying livelihoodsAccording to a study for the U.N., the continued loss of species could cost the world 18 percent of global economic output by 2050.Already, a number of industries have been economically impacted by species loss. The collapse of bee populations has hurt many in the $50 billion-a-year global honey industry. Atlantic cod in the waters off of Newfoundland formed the basis of the local economy since the 15th century — until overfishing the cod destroyed the livelihoods of local fishermen.What you can do about extinctionExtinction is hard to see. We may not realize how much of the natural world has been lost because the “baseline” shifts with every generation. Past generations would regard what we see as natural today as terribly damaged, and what we see as damaged today, our children will view as natural.Wooddell believes the most important thing one can do is to put pressure on Congress and elected leaders to create land management, pollution and other sustainable policies that will protect biodiversity and the environment. However, because it’s unlikely that these kinds of top-down policies will be instituted in the current political climate, she recommends mobilizing grassroots community groups to create “bottom-up” policies.Here are some other things you can do to protect endangered species and prevent extinction:- Eat less meat. Soybean production is one of the main causes of deforestation, and most soybean meal is used for animal feed.- Buy organic food because organic farmers use only non-synthetic or natural pesticides on their crops. Synthetic pesticides may be toxic for other organisms.- Choose sustainable seafood. The Marine Stewardship Council provides a list of certified sustainable fish for responsible eating.- Compost food waste. In New York City, the compost is used for urban farming and gardening, which provide habitat for pollinators.- Buy wood and paper products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, to ensure they’re harvested from responsibly managed forests.- Don’t buy products made from endangered or threatened species, such as tortoise shell, ivory, coral, some animal skins, and “traditional” medicines.- Be aware of the source of palm oil used in countless food and cosmetic products. Many tropical forests are being razed for palm oil plantations. If a product contains palm oil, make sure it’s from a deforestation-free plantation.- Reduce your use of plastic.- If you have a garden, plant native shrubs and flowers that attract butterflies and other pollinators. Milkweed is particularly helpful for monarch butterflies.- Set up a beehive.- Diversify your diet. Eating these 50 foods will promote biodiversity and a healthier plant.- Support and get involved with organizations that are helping endangered animals.- Join the Center for Biological Diversity and use their Take-Action Toolboxes.Correction: This post was updated on April 3, 2019 to remove a sentence about cownose rays devastating scallop populations off of North Carolina. It turns out that other studies have challenged those findings.A new UN report (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/climate/biodiversity-extinction-united-nations.html) finds that one million species are at risk of extinction; this is threatening ecosystems around the world that human beings need to survive.The Trump administration has put forth new rules that will significantly weaken the Endangered Species Act.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/climate/endangered-species-act-changes.html?module=inlineWouldn’t there be an evolutionary development that occurs when one species is gone? What happened when something like the Dodo went extinct? Did other creatures in its ecosystems adapt to perform the Dodo’s services? When I think about extinction, I always wonder what would have happened if the dinosaurs had not become extinct.I am late to the discussion about keystone species but since I have learned about the roles of these key animals to specific environments around the world I have tried and failed to see homo sapiens as a keystone species but rather I see us more like the ungulates, which when left unchecked by a corresponding predator, such as the wolf in the Yellow Stone Park scenario, would decimate any environment we occupy. We are overpopulating, over consuming, over producing items that are harmful to the entire world (such as plastics) and what will keep us in check? Who will be our wolves? Cancer? Illnesses? Violence? If humans disappeared from the earth, just suddenly vanished, I think the earth and all her flora and fauna would recover quickly. Our intelligence should curb our avarice, but I fear we are too shortsighted and too quick to rationalize away the science which spells out the looming disaster brought on my our ignorance and greed.Dear Deborah,Your analysis is very disturbing; and unfortunately, true.Nice post, keep it up.Endangered species are important. In my opinion, their absence can cause a break in the food chain or break synergies with other species, and thus a negative impact on them. One species and can change so much. Like a domino effect. We should take care of every species.I have been searching for a reasonable explanation of preservation of endangered species, and the search continues still. Apart from few redundant examples like bees or birds/animals taking part in pollinating processes or overgrowth/extinction, I can’t see any direct explanation on the outcomes of the extinctions of any species, viz. Tigers, Elephants, Rhinos, Deers etc. on the ecosystems or direct influence on humankind. Whereas, deforestation, excessive usage of fossil fuels, phytoplankton extinctions leading to global warming effects are easily understood, no such wide range of explanations and outcomes do exist on the extinction of species and their wide range of influences. Still looking for a reasonable explanation….can effect the food chain and thus effect humans less tigers mean more prey and then they will take up resources and could become extinct and so onI love animals!same, i hope we can work together to stop some animals from going extinct.Endangered Animals Matter Because If They Disappear, It Could Destroy Entire Ecosystems, STEA ( Save The Endangered Animals )Yes, absolutely!the thought of someone killing a poor turtle to make a stupid mirror just makes me want to cry! how could people be so cruel!?!?!?That’s the sad world we live in.I LOVE ANIMALS WE LOVE ANIMALS.HELP ANIMALS!That is a wild amount of money that bees are responsible for pollinating crops.I can’t believe that how many animals have gone extinctI know right, it is so sadI agree, without animals there would be no cures for horrible and possibly deadly diseases. Who knew that most of our endangered species helped with cures.Why do they endanger species this makes me madWe should save them, not hunt them. I hate the trump administrationI agree entirely.I wish all animals would live without the fear of extinction.I wish there was a way we could stop the cause of extinction and make a way to where more people would actually care.How do i cite this?This is so wonderful. It has lots of info. I absolutely love this site!This is such a great article with a great display of information!yo i think we should get alot of people to explore the water and to save animals to pick up trash too.bruh can they delete the trash out of the ocean using robots or elon musk can do somthingI don’t want any more animals to go extinctHi there! I just read the article on https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/03/26/endangered-species-matter and I found it informative. I appreciate how the author broke down complex ideas in a way that was easy to understand. It’s great to see content that is both engaging and educational. Thanks for sharing this resource!', 'url': 'https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/03/26/endangered-species-matter/', 'cleaned_text': 'Why Endangered Species Matter\nThe Endangered Species Act (ESA) was established in 1973 to protect “imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend” and help them recover.\nThe Trump administration has put forth a number of proposals that would weaken the ESA. These include measures to allow for the consideration of economic impacts when enforcing the ESA, ending the practice of automatically giving threatened species the same protection as endangered species, and making it easier to remove species from the endangered list.\n\nIn a way, this is nothing new because the ESA has been under attack for decades from construction, development, logging, water management, fossil fuel extraction and other industries that contend the act stifles economic development. But between 2016 and 2018 alone, there were almost 150 attempts to undercut the ESA; and last year, from July 8 to 22, Republicans in Congress or the Trump administration introduced 24 such measures and spending bill riders.\n\nThese bills included efforts to remove the gray wolf’s protected status in Wyoming and the western Great Lakes; a plan to remove from the endangered list the American burying beetle that lives on oil-rich land; and a strategy to roll back protection of the sage-grouse, which also inhabits oil-rich land in the West and whose numbers have declined 90 percent since the West was first settled. The Trump Administration recently opened up nine million acres of sage-grouse habitat to drilling and mining.\n\nEndangered species, if not protected, could eventually become extinct—and extinction has a myriad of implications for our food, water, environment and even health.\nExtinction rates are accelerating\nNinety-nine percent of all species that have ever lived have gone extinct over the course of five mass extinctions, which, in the past, were largely a result of natural causes such as volcano eruptions and asteroid impacts. Today, the rate of extinction is occurring 1,000 to 10,000 times faster because of human activity. The main modern causes of extinction are the loss and degradation of habitat (mainly deforestation), over exploitation (hunting, overfishing), invasive species, climate change, and nitrogen pollution.\n\nThere are also other threats to species such as the pervasive plastic pollution in the ocean—a recent study found that 100 percent of sea turtles had plastic or microplastic in their systems.\nEmerging diseases affecting more and more wildlife species such as bats, frogs and salamanders are the result of an increase in travel and trade, which allows pests and pathogens to hitch rides to new locations, and warming temperatures that enable more pests to survive and spread. Wildlife trafficking also continues to be a big problem because for some species, the fewer members there are, the more valuable they become to poachers and hunters.\n\nHow many species are endangered?\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, over 26,500 species are in danger of extinction. This includes 40 percent of amphibians, 34 percent of conifers, 33 percent of reef-building corals, 25 percent of mammals and 14 percent of birds. In the U.S., over 1,600 species are listed as threatened or endangered.\n\nA 2018 report by the Endangered Species Coalition found that ten species in particular are “imperiled” by the Trump administration’s proposals: California condor, giraffe, Hellbender salamander, Humboldt marten, leatherback and loggerhead sea turtles, red wolf, rusty patched bumble bee,San Bernardino kangaroo rat, West Indian manatee, and Western yellow-billed cuckoo.\nThe web of life\nWhile it may seem unimportant if we lose one salamander or rat species, it matters because all species are connected through their interactions in a web of life. A balanced and biodiverse ecosystem is one in which each species plays an important role and relies on the services provided by other species to survive. Healthy ecosystems are more productive and resistant to disruptions.\n\nA recent study found that extreme environmental change could trigger an “extinction domino effect.” One of the study’s authors said, “Because all species are connected in the web of life, our paper demonstrates that even the most tolerant species ultimately succumb to extinction when the less-tolerant species on which they depend disappear.” So saving one species means saving its habitat and the other species that live there too.\n“When you lose one species, it affects the ecosystem and everything around it gets a little bit more fragile while it adapts to change,” said Kelsey Wooddell, assistant director of the Earth Institute Center for Environmental Sustainability. “Even if it’s not a keystone species [a species that others in an ecosystem depend on], its loss will weaken the functionality of the entire ecosystem, which just makes it easier for that ecosystem to stop working.”\n\nWhat are the consequences of extinction?\nAltering ecosystems through cascading effects\nIf a species has a unique function in its ecosystem, its loss can prompt cascading effects through the food chain (a “trophic cascade”), impacting other species and the ecosystem itself.\nAn often-cited example is the impact of the wolves in Yellowstone Park, which were hunted to near extinction by 1930. Without them, the elk and deer they had preyed upon thrived, and their grazing decimated streamside willows and aspens, which had provided habitat for songbirds. This left the stream banks susceptible to erosion, and a decline in songbirds allowed mosquitoes and other insects the birds would have eaten to multiply. When the wolves were reintroduced to the park in 1995, they once again preyed on the elk; plant life returned to the stream banks and along with it, birds, beavers, fish and other animals. (Note: David Bernhardt, acting secretary of the Department of the Interior, just announced a proposal to strip gray wolves of their endangered status in the Lower 48 states.)\n\nKelp forests are another classic example. They play an important role in coastal ecosystems because they provide habitat for other species, protect the coastline from storm surges and absorb carbon dioxide.\n\nYet kelp forests are rapidly getting mowed down by exploding numbers of purple sea urchin. California sea otters eat the purple sea urchins that feed on giant kelp. These otters used to number in the hundreds of thousands to millions, but their population has been reduced to about 3,000 as a result of unchecked hunting in the 19th century and pollution. Moreover, in 2013 the sunflower starfish, which also eats purple sea urchins, began dying because of a virus that was likely exacerbated by warmer waters. Without the sea otter and the sunflower starfish predators, the purple sea urchin began feasting on the kelp forests, which declined 93 percent between 2013 and 2018. (A new study found that kelp forests are now also threatened by ocean heat waves.) The explosion of sea urchins not only damaged the kelp ecosystem, it also had serious impacts on Northern California’s red urchins that are valued for sushi. Fish that need the kelp forests for spawning, such as sculpin, rock cod and red snapper may become vulnerable in the future as well.\n\nAs another example, Wooddell explained that on Guam, after the invasive brown tree snake was accidentally introduced to the island in the 1950s, 10 of the island’s 12 endemic bird species went extinct. “Typically birds eat seeds and spread seeds elsewhere on the island but that is no longer a functioning ecosystem,” she said. “So the forest and the trees have decreased a lot. And Guam is covered in spiders because the birds are not there to eat them.”\n\nLosing apex species has multiple effects\nEliminating the large predators at the top of the food chain, the “apex species,” may be humans’ most serious impact on nature, according to one study. These large species are more vulnerable because they live longer, reproduce more slowly, have small populations, and\n\n'}, {'raw_text': '- Rates of natural and present-day species extinction- Recent extinction rates- Factors that cause extinction- Habitat loss- On land- Habitat loss- Rates of natural and present-day species extinctionWhich species are most vulnerable to extinction?Before a species becomes extinct, it must first be rare. Some species are naturally rare, while others have that rarity imposed upon them by one or more of the factors discussed above. Some species are much more vulnerable than others to becoming dangerously rare, and other species, when rare, are more likely than others of equal rarity to succumb. These and other factors affecting a species’ susceptibility to destruction are discussed in this section.Endemism and rarityAs previously discussed, a small geographic range makes a species particularly vulnerable to global extinction. Many of the threats to species are geographically restricted, so species with large ranges will survive somewhere even if they are locally extirpated. Species with small ranges do not have this “reserve.” Moreover, as also was mentioned above, species with small geographic ranges tend to be rare within them—they have low population densities.The collections of plants and animals on islands are often rich in endemic species; those species that are restricted to particular islands must inevitably have small ranges. Since 1600 the great majority of known bird extinctions have been on islands. The problem of extinction is not just limited to islands, however, as the previous sections amply describe.In sum, combined endemism and rarity are the factors that confer the greatest risk of extinction.Body size and related reproductive characteristicsGenerally, the larger the body size of an animal, the longer it lives and the fewer offspring it produces each year. Relatively large animals also tend to have relatively low population densities; thus, a viable population of, say, elephants occupies considerably more space than an equal-sized population of rabbits. Large predators such as tigers (Panthera tigris) have lower population densities than the herbivores on which they feed. A tiger has a home range that may occupy 100 square km (40 square miles), while a rabbit may survive in 1 hectare (0.004 square mile).Large animals, by virtue of their low population densities, are at increased risk of extinction. Moreover, an animal species that produces few offspring each year and that suffers a major loss in numbers from human activity will need more time to recover than a species with high reproductive rates. Again taking the tiger as an example, a tiger population large enough to avoid all the perils of low population size (including the chance that all offspring will be the same sex or that genetic inbreeding will occur) requires extremely large areas. Although the tiger is not considered an endemic species—it has a very large geographic range, stretching over much of eastern and southern Asia—its rarity in that range means that it is nonetheless vulnerable to extinction from human activity.BehaviourSize of home rangeIn the case of lions, wolves, and wild dogs, population size alone is a poor predictor of their local extinction, even when the animals live in protected areas. For these species, conflict with people on the borders of the protected areas is the major cause of mortality. Border areas are population “sinks,” areas where the death rate of the population exceeds the birth rate and into which individuals enter through migration from more-central portions of the protected area. This explains, for example, why African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus; see African hunting dog) are under particular threat—more so than other species, such as cheetahs and leopards, that also are afforded protected areas. Wild dogs live in large packs that roam very large areas, in contrast to the two cat species, which are mostly solitary and which have smaller home ranges. The more widely a species moves (i.e., the larger its home range), the more likely it is to move beyond areas where it is protected.ConcentrationSome species have aggregation behaviours that make them vulnerable to disturbance or hunting. For example, bats may congregate in large numbers in particular caves to have their young, making significant portions of their total population especially susceptible when their habitat is disturbed by human visitation or damaged by the cave’s commercialization or flooding. The various species of groupers often come together to spawn on a few nights of each year tied to phases of the moon and at traditional mating sites. Fishermen who know these sites and the timing of spawning can devastate large populations of these species by concentrating their efforts during this most vulnerable time in the fish’s life cycle.Low dispersalBecause small populations are so much more at risk than large ones, individuals of species that can readily disperse can rescue local populations on the verge of extinction. The previously discussed example of the checkerspot butterfly (see above Surviving but threatened small populations) illustrates, first, the rescue of some small populations by the dispersal of individuals from larger “reservoir” populations nearby and, second, the subsequent extinction of the reservoirs as urban development isolated them from still other butterfly populations that could have rescued them. Species that have low dispersal rates are at a disadvantage because it is unlikely that one population can save another.Mating systemsSmall populations suffer from inbreeding, an inevitable tendency of mating individuals in a small isolated population to be more closely related than they would be in a larger one. When population size is severely reduced, inbreeding may be the final insult that will cause the remaining population to go extinct. The likelihood that this will happen, however, seems related to the social structure of the species involved.A comparison of two species, a seal and a rhinoceros, serves to explore the issue in more detail. The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) of the Pacific Coast of North America was thought to have been hunted to extinction in the late 1800s, though it later became apparent that perhaps 20–30 individuals persisted locally for a couple of decades before the population began to recover gradually under protection. The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) in the early 20th century was reduced to two isolated populations—one numbering between 12 and 100, the other between 60 and 80—before protection allowed it to make a limited recovery. Moreover, not all of the rhinoceros males in the reduced population were likely to have bred. Today the elephant seal is genetically uniform, suggesting that a high degree of inbreeding occurred during the time its population was at a minimum, whereas the rhino has probably lost little of its genetic variability. The population histories of the two species are similar, so why the differences in their genetic variability?The social structures of elephant seals and rhinos are dramatically different. Each year, the one dominant bull seal that guards the harem is likely to father all of the young. An isolated seal population thus may become genetically uniform relatively quickly because very few males father each generation of young. Rhinos, on the other hand, are largely monogamous, so a group of them will have a greater number of fathers than a comparably sized group of seals.InsularityThe vulnerability of island species is likely a combination of two factors previously discussed—their endemism and rarity and their ecological naivete, the latter being exemplified by the greater effect of domestic cat introductions on unwary island bird species than on more “streetwise” mainland species. Nevertheless, some island bird species are less likely to be threatened than similar bird species found on continents. The reason lies in the abundance of island species—they are often quite numerous on their islands, for they have fewer competitors than do mainland species.Human useMany species are hunted for meat and other products, including whales and various fish, as discussed above. Less familiar is the widespread trade in bushmeat, which is essentially everything that can be hunted—from mice to chimpanzees and gorillas—and is especially prevalent in West and Central Africa. Yet other species are harvested for body parts, such as tiger bones and rhino horns, which are used in Asian medicines. A wide variety of plants are harvested too, again often for medicinal purposes. Simply put, any species that is used for food, wood, or medicine or as pets or houseplants, that is collected (such as butterflies or invertebrate shells), or that attracts attention for any other reason suffers an increased risk of extinction.', 'url': 'https://www.britannica.com/science/conservation-ecology/Which-species-are-most-vulnerable-to-extinction', 'cleaned_text': 'Rates of natural and present-day species extinction- Recent extinction rates- Factors that cause extinction- Habitat loss- On land- Habitat loss- Rates of natural and present-day species extinctionWhich species are most vulnerable to extinction?Before a species becomes extinct, it must first be rare.

Since time began, countless species have gone extinct from natural processes. The extinction of dinosaurs is the best known example.Why save endangered species?If extinction is a natural process, why should we make an effort to save endangered species? Because we can no longer attribute the accelerating extinction of plants and animals to natural causes. Today most species of plants and animals become extinct because of habitat destruction (loss of living space to development or pollution), introduction of non-native organisms, and direct killing (over-harvesting, poisoning). Florida\'s endangered wildlife includes the American crocodile (Figure 1), loggerhead sea turtle (Figure 2), the West Indian manatee (Figure 3).Changing PerceptionsOur understanding of the value of endangered species to humans has increased together with the recognition that human activities cause extinction. In general, benefits of species can be classified as ecological, economic, and social. Different combinations of benefits occur for any particular species, and some species are obviously more ""valuable"" than others.More important than knowing why a particular species is valuable is understanding why so many kinds of plants and animals are valuable.Biological DiversityThe assemblage of populations of plants and animals in an area is termed its ""biological diversity."" The term biological diversity is often used interchangeably (sometimes confusingly) with two other terms, ""genetic diversity"" and ""ecological diversity."" Genetic diversity (amount of genetic variability among individuals of the same species) and ecological diversity (number and relative abundance of species) are both components of biological diversity.Genetic diversity is directly related to a species\' ability to survive environmental change. For example, plants and animals can be characterized by their ability to exist under different climatic (moisture and temperature) conditions.However, within different species there is a certain amount of variability in the tolerance of individuals to climatic conditions. The ability of different species to cope with environmental--in this example climatic—change depends on this variability. When genetic variability is reduced, as with the Florida panther, the risk of extinction increases.The loss of a single species can set off a chain reaction affecting many other species. The total impact of extinction is not always apparent, and is difficult to predict, but it is clear that conserving biological diversity is essential for maintaining intact ecosystems.Benefits of Biological DiversityHow does maintaining biological diversity benefit humanity? It only takes a moment to realize that throughout history plants and animals have provided humans with food, clothing, energy, medicines, and structural materials. Today, solutions to problems in agricultural production in tropical countries, reliance on petrochemicals, and the cures for cancers may lie in organisms not yet discovered. It would be a shame to lose these benefits without even knowing we had them.EcotourismOne way that conservation of biological diversity is being linked directly to economic and social development is through a relatively new process called ecological tourism, or simply ecotourism. This is particularly important in developing countries that otherwise could not afford conservation programs. Example: The exploitation of renewable natural resources (woods, nuts, oils) in tropical rain forests may bring greater economic benefits than conversion to more intensive land uses.Agricultural BenefitsOnly a small proportion of the world\'s plants have been cultivated for food on a large-scale basis. Wild plants can benefit modern agriculture as sources for new crops, genetic material to improve existing crops, and as sources of new biodegradable pesticides. Many of our common foods have tropical origins and it is natural to turn to tropical forests as a source for new crops. The tropics are also a source for relatives of commercial species. Continual crossbreeding is necessary to improve crop yield, nutritional quality, adaptiveness to different growing conditions, and resistance to pests and diseases. Undiscovered plants have a great potential for providing new medicines. Many plants have developed chemical defenses to deter animals that eat them. These plants may becultivated to provide sources of bio-degradable pesticides in the future. Wild plants are also important as a source for new medicines. At least 25 per cent of all prescription drugs dispensed in the United States contain active principals that arestill extracted from higher plants. We should never forget that a lowly mold gave us penicillin.Unrecognized BenefitsUnrecognized benefits of maintaining biological diversity are those services we receive when ecosystems function normally. These ecosystem functions include energy fixation, chemical cycling (oxygen production by rainforests), soil generation and maintenance, ground water recharge, water purification, and flood protection. These services are provided to us at no cost.When we destroy the ability of ecosystems to function naturally we not only lose these free services but all too often have to pay to replace them. There is no more dramatic example of the problems caused by ecosystem degradation and species endangerment than the loss of wetlands, especially the Everglades, in Florida. Floods, problems in water quality and quantity for natural and human systems, and declines in fish and wildlife populations have all been linked to the drainage of the Everglades. The price tag for fixing these problems is hundreds of millions of dollars.Species as IndicatorsCertain species are especially important as indicators of environmental quality. Endangered species act as our miner\'s canary, they tell us when something is wrong in our life-support system. The rapid decline in bald eagles and peregrine falcons was a dramatic warning of the dangers of DDT.Many non-endangered species are used to monitor environmental quality. In Florida, largemouth bass and other sportfish have warned us of mercury contamination in freshwater ecosystems, and the spread of cattails into freshwater marshes formerly dominated by sawgrass warned us of nutrient problems in the Everglades. Without environmental monitors, we may not have learned of these contaminants until much more damage was done.What You Can doThe conservation and management of threatened and endangered species is a tremendous challenge. Because of efforts of federal, state, regional, and local agencies—sometimes in cooperation with private interests—some endangered species now have a better chance of survival. The involvement of every individual, especially private citizens is essential. The following list includes some of the things you can do to help save endangered species:- Support the Nongame Program of the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.- Support the imperiled species program of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.- Visit a national, state or local park where resident naturalists describe local ecosystems. Look into volunteer activities at these locations.- Attend public hearings concerning land and water use decisions. Regional planning Councils, water management districts, and county and city commissions are all charged with the responsibility of making decisions affecting biological diversity. Become informed, then involved.- Report violations of conservation laws to federal and state authorities.- Plant a refuge for wildlife (and energy and water conservation).

Since time began, countless species have gone extinct from natural processes. The extinction of dinosaurs is the best known example.\n\nIf extinction is a natural process, why should we make an effort to save endangered species? Because we can no longer attribute the accelerating extinction of plants and animals to natural causes. Today most species of plants and animals become extinct because of habitat destruction (loss of living space to development or pollution), introduction of non-native organisms, and direct killing (over-harvesting, poisoning). Florida\'s endangered wildlife includes the American crocodile, loggerhead sea turtle, the West Indian manatee.\n\nOur understanding of the value of endangered species to humans has increased together with the recognition that human activities cause extinction. In general, benefits of species can be classified as ecological, economic, and social. Different combinations of benefits occur for any particular species, and some species are obviously more ""valuable"" than others.\n\nMore important than knowing why a particular species is valuable is understanding why so many kinds of plants and animals are valuable.\nThe assemblage of populations of plants and animals in an area is termed its ""biological diversity."" The term biological diversity is often used interchangeably (sometimes confusingly) with two other terms, ""genetic diversity"" and ""ecological diversity."" Genetic diversity (amount of genetic variability among individuals of the same species) and ecological diversity (number and relative abundance of species) are both components of biological diversity.\n\nGenetic diversity is directly related to a species\' ability to survive environmental change. For example, plants and animals can be characterized by their ability to exist under different climatic (moisture and temperature) conditions.\n\nHowever, within different species there is a certain amount of variability in the tolerance of individuals to climatic conditions. The ability of different species to cope with environmental--in this example climatic—change depends on this variability. When genetic variability is reduced, as with the Florida panther, the risk of extinction increases.\n\nThe loss of a single species can set off a chain reaction affecting many other species. The total impact of extinction is not always apparent, and is difficult to predict, but it is clear that conserving biological diversity is essential for maintaining intact ecosystems.\n\nHow does maintaining biological diversity benefit humanity? It only takes a moment to realize that throughout history plants and animals have provided humans with food, clothing, energy, medicines, and structural materials. Today, solutions to problems in agricultural production in tropical countries, reliance on petrochemicals, and the cures for cancers may lie in organisms not yet discovered. It would be a shame to lose these benefits without even knowing we had them.\n\nOne way that conservation of biological diversity is being linked directly to economic and social development is through a relatively new process called ecological tourism, or simply ecotourism. This is particularly important in developing countries that otherwise could not afford conservation programs. Example: The exploitation of renewable natural resources (woods, nuts, oils) in tropical rain forests may bring greater economic benefits than conversion to more intensive land uses.\n\nOnly a small proportion of the world\'s plants have been cultivated for food on a large-scale basis.

### Key Factors for Species Vulnerability:

*   **Specialized Needs:** Species with limited diets (e.g., pandas and bamboo) or small, specific habitats are less adaptable to environmental changes.
*   **Low Reproductive Rates:** Animals that reproduce slowly, like whales and elephants, cannot recover quickly from population declines caused by threats.
*   **Human Pressures:** Targeted threats like **habitat loss**, overexploitation, and climate change disproportionately impact certain species over others.

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) reports that **around 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction**.

As former IPBES Chair Sir Robert Watson stated, ""The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever."" This combination of biological vulnerability and intense external pressure explains the disparity in endangerment levels.

Tell me about some weird habits that some people have.,"['informational', 'simple', 'non-technical', 'question', 'fact', 'people and society', 'research', 'non-sensitive']","[{'raw_text': 'Although we all have habits that seem to prove that, as human beings, we are rather odd creatures, there are some habits that form part of people\'s daily routines which take things the extra mile. From the curious to the downright bizarre, here are ten peculiar habits people actually have, but you may not be aware of.1. Getting Completely Naked to PoopYou might think most people simply pull down their pants to their ankles to take a dump but holy moly! It appears there is a whole army of people out there who have to get stark naked before floating their load. We\'re not talking about simply busting one out naked before having a shower - this is a real bonafide must do for every single nugget dropped, meaning that pooping in a public facility is an absolute no-no.2. Pillow BuryingWe have a soft spot for pillows (excuse the pun); there\'s nothing like your face hitting one after a long hard day. But some folks take their love for pillows to a whole new level. Although to some people, this might sound like the perfect claustrophobic nightmare, others actually have a thing about entirely covering themselves with pillows either while lying in bed or watching TV. One of the strangest forms of self-soothing we\'ve heard of in a while!3. Number CrushingMany of us might have a lucky number, or might avoid the number 13 for fear of it being unlucky. But imagine having to execute pretty much all of your daily actions - washing hands, shutting doors, brushing your teeth - in even numbers, because you have an aversion to odd numbers. Or how about having to have everything in your house - like your thermostat, volume controls, and alarm clocks - set to odd numbers because only odd numbers feel right? This strong need to count and have your life governed by odd, even, or certain numbers is otherwise known as arithmomania.4. Sleep DrivingOkay, so sleep walking or sleep eating is not exactly something to raise your eyebrows at, but how about sleep driving? Eek! Taking the meaning of going for a night drive to a whole other level, some people actually get up, take their car for a ride, return, hop back into bed, and remember nothing of it. A strange and risky habit indeed.5. Breath SyncingTo most people, breathing is just something that happens without us even thinking about it. Your breathing rate is set by your subconscious mind. Job done. Or is it? What if you could only breathe in set patterns? Or had to breathe in time to any music you listened to? Breathing could suddenly go from something that you take entirely for granted to an overwhelming daily experience - no joke. This phenomenon is known as sensorimotor obsession, more commonly known as a body-focused obsession.6. Eating the UnthinkableFancy eating the foam out of your pillow? Or perhaps a spot of cleaning sponge with a side of toilet paper? How about some good old-fashioned mud, a wedge of brick, or a chunk of wood? Unbelievably, some people would rather chow down on these oddities as opposed to tonight\'s dinner - a condition otherwise known as pica. This strange condition where people eat non-food items of no nutritional value is increasing. And they\'re not even pregnant.7. Whiffy BehaviourWe all know that old books smell so good, and who can blame people if they want to smell them all day; and, of course we\'re all guilty of a bit of pit smelling. But did you know that some people cannot get enough of smelling other things, such as their own fingernails, mildew-scented towels, Play Doh (yes, really), and even laundry detergent? People literally cannot go through a day without smelling some downright oddities, otherwise known as having an olfactory obsession.8. Hair HatingMost of us have been guilty of plucking our eyebrows to smithereens at one time or another, but the habit of hair tearing - otherwise known as trichotillomania - takes the habit of pulling hair, whether it be from from your scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows, or pubic area - to a whole different level. Incredibly for some, hair tearing is actually a self-soothing act, luring people into a trance-like state that can become incredibly addictive.9. Blow Drying ""Down There""Truth be told, it is not just a strange whim of certain celebrities that have a habit of blow drying their nether regions to make sure their lady gardens and so forth are bone dry after a shower. Although there is a logical argument for doing this, in that it is claimed to prevent yeast infections, for some it\'s purely about the comforting caress of warm air ""down there."" No towel needed.10. Rehearsing, RepeatingYou think you\'re having a pretty normal conversation with a friend, but what if you knew that conversation - and every other conversation you had with them - had in some way been rehearsed and then repeated with different outcomes? We\'ve probably all tossed and turned over a conversation that didn\'t turn out particularly well, but for some people this quirky habit, and making sure they have an answer for every eventuality, is part of their daily thread of life.You never really know what goes on behind closed doors, but maybe now, you might just have a better idea!

In that, I have acquired a lot of personal habits which to some might seem weird, annoying or strange. This post summarizes them all.Countries I've lived in: Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Belgium, Colombia, the US, Canada, Ireland, UK, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Egypt, Italy, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Turkey, India, the Philippines, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Australia (I've also visited Poland, Uruguay, Singapore, Austria, Slovakia, Norway, and Mexico for a few days or weeks, but definitely wouldn't consider myself to have lived in any of these and was more of a tourist, and I've had a flight transfer through a bunch other countries for a few hours, which I wouldn't count at all).I can point you to travelers who have been to many more countries than I have (most of whom have been travelling way less than I have, so it really shows the different speeds we travel at), but my style of travel and theirs is very different and I feel like I have gotten to know the modern cultures of each of these countries much more than the majority of passers-through ever do.The thing about living in a country and truly attempting to understand its culture and language, is that you have to pick up a lot of their customs to stand out less and make them feel more comfortable. Some of these I have done only in passing and stopped almost immediately after leaving the country, but quite a few (as you'll see here) have stuck with me for life.In today's post, I want to share a few of the strangest habits that I have picked up!1. Ask people if they want to have a shower way too oftenThis strange custom is one that I picked up from spending an entire year in Brazil.I travelled a lot in the country, and had my own home some of the time, but the rest of the time would stay with friends. It struck me as incredibly odd, but the first question Brazilians would ask me whenever I arrived at their home was always if I wanted to have a shower!This wasn't saying anything about my B.O., but something that is customary to offer any guest who is visiting you in Brazil, including if they are not staying over. Brazil can be a hot country depending on the city and time of year, and Brazilians are among the most hygienic people I've ever come across, generally taking at least two and sometimes three showers a day, especially if they are physically active (gym, sports etc.)Because of this, Brazilians generally want to have a shower as soon as they arrive at someone's house, to freshen up. The problem is that I'm so used to asking this that any time I have a Couchsurfer over at my place, or if it's a somewhat hot day anywhere in the world and someone pops by my house, I just automatically ask the question of if they want to hop in the shower as soon as they enter.You can imagine the looks I've gotten from asking this when people think I'm somehow implying they are smelly, or a girl who may be just a friend or a very different age to me thinking I have an ulterior motive! I'm just trying to be nice, as any Brazilian would, I swear!2. Examine a business card or hand over money as if it were about to explodeThis time, a habit I picked up in Taiwan, which stood out for me immediately after I arrived there, was that you treat anything that you can hand over to another person as sacred.So if I meet you at a conference for instance, and you give me your business card, rather than glance at it and stuff it into my pocket, I will delicately accept it using both of my hands as if I'm holding a fragile piece of crystal and examine it closely for the incredible design, as if I was looking through a window into a wonderful parallel universe.Only then can I put it into my left pocket, which is my “throw-into-the-bin-as-soon-as-they're-gone” pocket.And with money, the same rules apply. You don't hand over any note with one hand, but with two, as if it will explode if handled incorrectly. I have shaken off this second habit due to spending long enough outside of Asia by now, but I have to admit that I still feel quite insulted whenever someone hands me money with one hand without forcefully putting their whole body into the delicate transfer. I definitely still take business cards with both hands though.3. Point as if you're flirting with a fishIn the Philippines, and strangely enough also in Colombia and other countries, they almost never point with their index finger (thus immediately nullifying the very title of index finger). This is considered quite rude in many cultures.So what do you do if you genuinely need to point to something? Why, you use your lips of course! You need to pout them as if you are making a kissy-face and do so in the direction of the thing that requires the attention of the conversation. It's not a long “point”, but more a quick pucker-up for a half a second.I got so used to this, that I do it unconsciously now, even when I'm also pointing with my fingers too. So I look weird to pretty much everyone now!4. Feel guilty about using the toiletThis is an odd one, but many countries in the world don't have the same kind of plumbing system as we do in Europe and North America.As such, in many countries in Africa, South America and Asia, you can't flush toilet paper down the toilet!Because of this, there is a bin beside the toilet for you to discard your “used” toilet paper. It seems disgusting at first to have that within sight, but after a while you get used to it. Now, I genuinely feel… guilty every time I flush toilet paper down the toilet itself, even when in a country where this is perfectly acceptable as the plumbing system can handle it, because I feel like I'm clogging up the pipes!5. Call people at random intervals and hang up before they answerAnother habit I picked up, this time from Italy is the concept of a “squillo”.You may generally understand this as a missed call, although it is always intentional. We do this all the time in most countries if we want to give someone our number, by noting theirs and then calling them just for a second, and they'd see our number on their caller ID.Italians however take this to the next level and make it an entirely new form of communication! I wrote about it in detail here.Basically, you call someone and then hang up such that the context of why you called is obvious. If you are meeting up with them but will arrive 10 minutes late, the squillo implies that you are on your way. If you are going out with someone and not meeting up with them right now but receive a very quick call where they hang up before you would pick up, this means that they are thinking about you (lovers or married couples etc.) If a guy friend gives another guy friend a squillo, it essentially means “whats up?” and you would text him back.Essentially, you have these random moments throughout your day where your phone rings for just a second and then stops ringing. Now, the instinct of most non-Italians is to call this person back. Maybe it's their way of saying they are out of credit for instance, and it's urgent they talk to you. But the squillo itself was the communication; you have to extrapolate from the context what it means without calling them back!As such, I call friends and hang up immediately all the time. In most countries though, they'll call me back and we have an awkward conversation, which I was attempting to avoid precisely by giving them a squillo! I still can't shake this habit, and have many weird phone conversations if people pick up before I finish my brief squillo, or think that I'm trying to get out of being the one paying for the call.6. Regularly run into oncoming traffic as if you have had enough of this cruel worldAs always, in my attempts to really get into a local culture, I tried to emulate the Egyptians as much as I could while living there this year. One problem though is that there are pretty much no traffic lights in major cities in Egypt; especially for the purposes of pedestrian crossings.As such, your only option to get where you need to go is to run across five or more lanes of very rapidly approaching traffic to cross the road. At first you are as scared as hell, but then you get used to it.Now, I'm in Germany which is as far as you can get from this idea as possible! German pedestrians will patiently wait at a red man traffic light even when there are literally no cars within sight. My first time in Germany, I got used to this and blended in. This time though, Egypt has gotten into my brain too much and I jaywalk all the time. I almost feel the urge to run into traffic when cars are zooming by, even though I'd only have to wait a few seconds and walk a few more metres for a pedestrian crossing.It's weird and I hope I shake this feeling soon before I get run over!7. Unnecessarily drop money all over the placeOne of the weirdest customs I've come across by far is in North America (both the US and Canada), where many waiters and waitresses are paid by customers rather than their boss (ridiculous, I know!)They have this weird concept called “tipping”, where (and yes, I'm serious about this!!) you punish a waiter/waitress if the food that they didn't prepare isn't to your satisfaction, or if the restaurant they don't own is busy and slowed down by no fault of their own. You also punish them if you happen to be in a bad mood that day, or if you are not earning enough money to be feeling generous enough to be spreading more around. Basically, you punish them by reducing the wage they rely on, for absolutely any reason you can think of, especially if it is not within their control.This essentially means that their ability to earn a living is controlled more by dumb luck than anything else. To “punish” them, what you do is… pay something close to what is actually printed on your bill and requested that you pay. (Are you with me so far?) If, however, the waiter performs their task within your satisfaction, then you reward them with 15% of what your bill will be. If they carried the plates from the kitchen to your table extra skilfully, then you make it 20%!I know, it makes no sense whatsoever – even though the effort of their work is the same, if you order the least expensive meal on the menu, they will earn less because the 15-20% is applied to what you ordered, even though they personally didn't prepare it or pay for the ingredients. To make things more confusing, this “tipping” insanity is applied to some but not all of those who provide you with some kind of service. To pizza delivery, but not garbage collectors, to taximen, but not bus drivers.I have been given vast explanations about why this is necessary, none of which make any sense to me compared to the waiter/waitress/pizza-delivery-boy just earning a normal salary like everyone else. They sometimes resort to sob stories about those waiters' lives, ignoring how this same logic can equally be applied to teachers, nurses and many other very hard workers who (for whatever twist of logic) are not tipped and may not earn well.But the fact of the matter is that this backwards system is not the waiters' fault, and I don't like punishing people for events outside of their control, so I always leave 15-20% extra. Rather than formally process this money though, the custom is to leave it on the table in plain view and walk away, as if the money is just more filth to be cleaned up, with your crumbs and dirty forks. And yes, I'm not making this up!I got so used to this odd custom from living over 18 months in the US and Canada, that I can't shake it, and to this day I leave money on tables in Europe and Asia even though they get paid a standard wage by their boss in most places. I've been programmed to be “a good tipper”, even though I complain more than anyone about how idiotic a concept it is.Once, a waitress in Taiwan chased me down the street and said that I just left a heap of NT$ on the table! She asked me why I would do that when I already paid for my meal, and I honestly told her that I had no idea.. it was a force of habit! It's like an annoying twitch for me now! An expensive (and unnecessary in most places outside of North America) annoying twitch…8. Sentimental hellos and goodbyes every timeTime in Latin countries in general means that you simply cannot just say “hi” to those you meet in social situations. If either person is a girl, then you give a peck on the cheek… or two… or even three or four in some places! And in other places even guys do this between one another.In places like Brazil you go a step further and embrace the person you see. You may have just seen them yesterday, but you still hug them as if you haven't seen them for years and they have just been released from a decade in solitary confinement.This warmth between people in social situations is contagious and very hard to shake. Also from Brazil, if I'm talking to someone I will maintain eye contact and even be touching them if possible – this has nothing to do with flirting, because even if guys are talking between one another you will keep your hand on one of their shoulders, and tug them a little if they happen to glance off into a different direction.Finally, when it's time to say goodbye (as in, see you tomorrow, not forever!) you have to give your farewells to each person in the group. This means that good-nights can take a really long time. In many Latin countries, I have learned to say the first goodbye about a half an hour before I actually have to leave, as I know it will take that long to get through everyone and wrap up our conversations.The idea of just getting up and saying “OK, see you all later!” and walking away, makes me shudder!9. Slowly move many standing conversations in the direction I'm facingAnother consequence of the above point of more warmth in Latin countries, is that I have greatly reduced this horrible concept we have in some Northern European and North American countries of a personal bubble.When you are talking with someone, you should do it a little closer to make sure that there is a greater sense of intimacy in the conversation (once again, this is between guys or with girls).As such, whenever I am back in North America, or North Europe, if I'm sitting down, I always feel like the person I'm speaking to is too far away, and I'll lean in. If I'm standing though, I'll simply take a small step forward. A Northerner will then counter this with a small step back as I have been so bold as to enter their personal bubble. (Incidentally, the greater distance between people is perhaps one reason why Americans are so well renowned for their.. um.. skill for projecting their voice in public places more than the rest of us – they have to because everyone is so far away!)This means that when standing, I try to reduce this wide gap between me and the other person, as it feels uncomfortable, and I may take a little step forward. The other person though, will do the exact opposite and increase the distance between us, as it otherwise feels uncomfortable to them. As a consequence, the conversation will always slowly move in whatever direction I happen to be facing.Both of us do this unconsciously, and I'm always amazed when I look around me and realize that I'm suddenly several metres from where I initially started this conversation!10. Take two hours to drink a single espressoWhile living in France, I got used to this idea that an espresso is not about filling your blood up with caffeine, but about the experience of sitting at a café and enjoying the company of the person you are with, or if alone taking your time reading a book. As such, you order just one single espresso and take as much as several hours to slowly sip your way through it.Obviously this means that you are essentially sipping a cool drink most of the time; it doesn't matter though, as its purpose is just an excuse to sit down at this café.This contrasts strongly with France's neighbours, the Italians who frequently drink an espresso as if it were a shot and throw it back. Or with North Americans who drink coffee because they want to fill their blood up with caffeine, and as such many places there present an espresso or coffee in general in a hideous plastic cup.I don't drink coffee except socially or when I want to sit down at a café to study or read (never to wake up in the morning for instance), but when I do order a coffee it's always an espresso in a nice little cup and it always takes me forever to drink it. Long lunches with French co-workers reminded me that the rest of us tend to be in way too much of a hurry when we sit down to eat or drink, making it too functional about getting those liquids and solids plonked into your stomach acids as soon as possible.11. Nuke 700 friendsAs part of my continued attempt to truly integrate and understand a local culture, my attempts to make friends in the Netherlands required so much lateral thinking, that I had a philosophical break-down of sorts on what the concept of friendship truly means.Their circle of friends tends to be so tight, that it's incredibly hard to break into it, especially if you don't work or study with Dutch people. People I'd meet in parties that we were both attending downright refused to hang out with me any time later. A narrow-minded traveler would conclude that they are assholes and leave it at that (and sadly, most foreigners who live in Amsterdam tend to have very few local friends), but I couldn't do this as I needed to improve my Dutch and was there specifically to find out what makes Dutch people tick.Despite the fact that I was only there for eight weeks, I took this investigation of how to make friends so seriously that it broke down the very fabric of what the concept of what having a friend meant for me. I eventually succeeded in getting into someone's inner circle, but the price was that now it was too late to go back and this new understanding of friendship had infiltrated my brain permanently.Now, I simply cannot seriously call someone a friend unless we genuinely know one another, or are part of some tight community.Because of this, one of the first things I did in my transition to being stricter on who I call a friend, was to go into Facebook and nuke 700 people that I had added by meeting once in passing, or classmates from school I didn't really know, or even an old friend who I had lost touch with for too long. The number of Facebook friends I have oscillates between 60 and 90 now, and I do regular spring cleaning to keep the number low.I really can't go back; to me the concept of having almost a thousand “friends” seems ludicrous and I roll my eyes every time I get a friend request from someone I barely know, or don't know at all. Of course, I have a public setting on my Facebook page that people are welcome to follow, because I select updates and certain information to be either public or private, but why would I want to share some personal events in my life with someone I don't know?Unfortunately, this Dutch view of appreciating “true” friendships more than call absolutely everyone you come across a friend (rather than an acquaintance which is more accurate), doesn't jive with the rest of the world well at all.Some people have gotten very offended that I haven't accepted their friend request, taking it almost like a personal insult, when ironically I am equally insulted that they have 2,000 “friends” and have no standards whatsoever on who they count as one. It's even more frustrating because people have a stereotype of travelers having nothing but superficial friends that they cast on me, the hypocrisy of which boils my blood when coming from someone with four digits of people in their network that they can't possibly know.12. Being friendly with those in authorityIn stark contrast to the one just above, I still maintain the very Irish philosophy that a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet, and am open to ultimately considering anyone a friend, and especially to genuinely be friendly to people as soon as I meet them.I put no limits whatsoever on this concept (within reason). In Ireland, we have a tradition to talk to everyone with the same level of informality, regardless of wealth or status level. This includes police officers in the street (yes, we'd invite them to the pub for a drink; I can't imagine sunglasses-wearing American police putting up with such friendliness towards them!), and your teachers in an adult language learning class. Everyone can be put on the same level and talked to informally.This “lack of respect” has gotten me into serious trouble on some occasions with immigration officers, police officers, and my teachers. I have always found this formal/informal separation hard to get used to.13. Haggle all the time, and without ever even saying a priceA wonderful skill that I picked up while living in India was the ability to haggle like the Indians do. This is very different to how we do it in the west (I say $10, you say $20, and we meet somewhere in the middle etc.), and has helped me secure fantastic prices on accommodation, and any items I may buy.As I always tell people, being able to travel the world isn't about earning lots of money, but learning how to spend what you have wisely.Basically, rather than give a price yourself, you just refuse the prices they suggest to you and keep listing various random problems with what they are offering until they start reducing the price. You should never show that you are particularly interested in the item. Even your body language has to incorporate this, and you generally look over your shoulder at the item, ready to walk away. It is simply how haggling works in India.I do this all the time in other places and it's incredibly effective! Unless the price is printed on something, then it is always negotiable. I especially like buying items at flea markets because my Indian haggling skills come in quite handy! But I do it with accommodation whenever I can.When I mixed Indian haggling techniques with Brazilian charm, I managed to get the best place I've ever lived in in my life – a huge penthouse apartment in Rio with a 270 degree panoramic view that included the Christ statue and sugar loaf mountain, very close to Copacabana beach etc. – for a few hundred dollars a month back in 2006! Since my job is location-independent, I haggle everything, everywhere 😉14. Carry around a lighter even though I never have and never will smokeA habit I picked up in Turkey learning Turkish and have kept with me whenever I'm in a country where way too many people smoke (such as this year in Egypt), is to always carry a lighter in my pocket.The thing is, I think smoking is a disgusting habit, and whenever I'm in these countries I feel like I'm back in the '50s, and am reluctant to go to smoky bars or nightclubs, since they don't realize how much they are polluting their own (and my) lungs. But there's little I can do about it because people are smoking everywhere.Even though someone is addicted to their cigarettes, for some strange reason they don't ever seem to have a lighter most of the time! I mean, if I were a smoker, I would have my own lighter – it just makes sense to me.But a consequence of this is that it's very common to approach strangers and ask if they have a light, and was one of the most frequent interactions I had with people. By having a lighter, I had the chance to ask them a different question while I was lighting up their cigarette and get some language practice or ask about interesting events I could check out nearby. It's become a force of habit, and I carry a lighter in my pocket about half of the year because of this!15. Cover pizzas with ketchupWhile Americans may find it weird that us Europeans take mayonnaise, look at French fries, and “drown them in that shit” some places take this to a whole new level!One such idea is what they do in Rio de Janeiro – if you are eating a pizza there, you cover it with ketchup. So you'll take a sachet of ketchup (since they rarely come in bottles there) per slice and drown your pizza with it.The thing is, I spent almost four months in Rio, most of the time trying to blend in as a Carioca, so I picked up this and many other habits. Now, no matter where I am, I apply this whenever I'm eating pizza and ketchup is handy. It gets me endless raised eyebrows…16. Sleeping in the middle of the dayWhen you are in Spain and it's the early afternoon, everything is closed and you have a 2+ hour break from work. It's also hot as hell in the summer, so you don't want to be walking around outside the shade.As such, I got used to the idea of finding nice shade under a tree, or even going home if it's convenient, and having a siesta.Even though this is way less typical in other countries, I have a power nap now every single day, no matter where I am. This biphasic sleeping pattern comes with many advantages such as needing to sleep less overall, and getting over jet lag quickly.17. Tell the truth so much it hurtsThe Germans may have an odd reputation, but my experience has been that they are not rude at all. In Germany, and some other Northern European countries (and with the deaf community in the states), it's more normal to be straight with people, and give them the direct truth without sugar coating it. Being direct is a way to show that you respect that person. This wonderful concept is one that I have picked up and emulated myself, and it has helped me integrate into these cultures much better.In some other countries though, especially Canada, the opposite is true, and you are required to sandwich any unfortunate truths between compliments, or buffer it with pleasantries. To me now, this beating around the bush is all a total waste of time.As such, I have to constantly remind myself when with certain cultures to add in lots of misleading words like “That's a pretty good idea, but how about if…” (instead of “That idea is terrible. This one is better”) or “I'll think about it!” (instead of “No way in hell”) and other nonsense, that you say for no reason other than to protect the feelings of the person you are speaking to.A Canadian commenter on my Facebook, Sofie, said this to really emphasize the differences: I was taking pictures of the food at a Starbucks (in Germany) and for some weird reason, that's not allowed. A worker there came up to me: “Don't take pictures please,” he said very strictly. In Canada, that would go something more like this: “Hello. I am so sorry but we prefer it if customers don't take pictures. Thank you very much for your cooperation, we appreciate it. Have a nice day.”Of course, when I speak more “efficiently” with people in some countries this comes across as too blunt. Once again I'm left offending people and then feeling frustrated myself that nobody is straight with me (for constructive purposes) and that I feel like I'm stuck in a dialogue with Barney the pink and happy dinosaur.18. Have the weirdest exclamationsWhenever I stub my toe, or feel angry and curse, or give out a happy exclamation, the thing is that it's not usually in English unless I'm surrounded by English speakers. Generally these things come out of me in another language without me thinking twice about it, including if I'm alone.For instance, if I hurt myself, instead of saying “Ow!” or “Ouch!” I'll actually say Owa!! (as in German, written Aua) or ¡Ay! (in Latin America) depending on which language is lingering around in my brain at the time.When I feel like cursing, I feel I can express it better with Spain‘s “¡¡Me cago en…!!” (with colourful continuations of that, including la leche, la puta que te parió, la Virgen, la hostia and more; it's a pretty versatile phrase).19. Translate weird expressions that shouldn't be translatedI've got a pretty good way of not mixing up languages, but it isn't perfect! As such, some will ooze into other ones, and this includes invasions into my English.There are some things that you simply say all the time in other languages, but don't in English.For instance, the first weeks after coming back from Egypt and speaking Arabic, I found that any time I referred to the future, I was missing an “Inshallah”. As an atheist, I am hardly going to say “God willing” in English, but I did keep over-using a somewhat equivalent “Hopefully” – and way too much. “I'll see you tomorrow at lunch time… hopefully!” “Next year the world cup will take place in Brazil… hopefully!” and other very odd uses.Many languages also have a subjunctive form used to express hope that something will happen, whereas in English we just use an imperative. This means that I have awkwardly back-translated Spanish's “¡Que te diviertas!” to “May you have fun!” and then realized how weird that sounds only after it has come out of my mouth.Some individual words are really missing from English, and I use their weak translations even when I shouldn't. For instance, the word “Si” in French or “Doch” in German means “Yes” when answering a negative question, to avoid confusion that you are contradicting what was said rather than the actual meaning of agreeing with it.So I tend to overuse “Indeed!” in these situations in English. Aren't you coming? Weren't you already in that place? Can't you swim? – indeed! This obviously doesn't answer the question well at all! Indeed yes or indeed no??Then there are the set expressions. I have actually said “To live like a king's body!” (Vivir a cuerpo de rey – instead of to live like a king – what can I say, the Spanish one makes more sense, since a king's mind has to worry about wars and famine and all that unpleasantness!)20. Confusing hand signalsIn some countries, the way you express certain ideas are very different to other ones. It took me months to shake off the Filipino way of expressing that you want to get the menu or bill in a restaurant, but even to this day if I want to really emphasize that something is “full”, I do a very Brazilian open-close hand movements with all my fingers together. It's unconscious at this stage.After almost six entire months in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, I couldn't help but count in a very Chinese way on my fingers. To this day, six feels more natural to make a “telephone” shape with one hand, than to start using a second hand.“Delicious” feels more natural to drill my index finger into my chin, rather than to rub my tummy (something else I picked up from the Italians), and if you stop me in the street and ask for directions (in any language), rather than show “walk” as two fingers of a hand moving, thanks to learning sign language, I use both hands in a forward-backward wave motion.21. Never wearing shoes in housesThis tradition is so prominent everywhere that I can't even think any more what countries don't do it! So many European and Asian and South American countries leave their shoes at the entrance – while in the house (yours or someone else's) you go around in your socks or bare feet.As such, when in America and visiting a friend, if I take off my shoes at their door I always get the weirdest look from them.22. Applauding whenever my plane landsThis very odd custom is one you'll find popular between many countries, that us Northerners (EU/America) find very odd. I generally wouldn't initiate it, but if as much as one other person begins clapping, then I join along and give the plane a huge round of applause as soon as we touch down!People get cynical about flying a lot, but I still think that it's a pretty amazing thing and an advance in technology we take for granted too much. I love how Louis CK discusses it in this video. So yeah, a big round of applause to the wonders of science getting me somewhere in a few hours that would have been a journey of several months just a few centuries ago!23. Awkward social interactions when mixing up the rulesAs you can imagine, there are some contradictions above (being stricter on what a friend is, but still being friendly with everyone? Being straight with people, but then lying and pretending to care about the craftsmanship of that crappy logo and brainless motto you've put on your business card?) – this is my life in a nutshell!I have such a mess of social rules that disagree with themselves bouncing around in my head, that every single time I start talking to a new person I end up slipping up on one of them, and giving them one too many pecks on the cheek, being too close or too far away when talking, being too straight with them and offending them, or not being straight enough with them and having them not take me seriously.It's certainly exhausting that I essentially have to change everything about how I interact with people so regularly because I bounce around so much. It's gotten to the extent that I find it impossible to say what comes naturally to me any more. Many things on this list come naturally to me now, but I try to suppress them if they aren't natural to the country I am currently in. Customs that I grew up with and were a natural part of my world for two decades have had to be unlearned so that I can make new friends across the planet easier.Or what about if you invite a girl out for a date? Should you be more Latin and traditional and hold the chair for her, pay for the meal, and tell her she's pretty? Well then prepare yourself for a very offended girl if she happens to be from some countries where all that is patrionizing and a little sexist.In travelling all this time, I have had to not only learn multiple languages, but I've had to learn multiple sets of social rules and “fluently” switch between them as I meet people of different nationalities. Whenever I'm successful, I can proudly say that I have made a new connection because they feel more comfortable with me, seeing that I talk to them like their peers back home do. But if I slip up even a little, then I can easily offend people, or (for me just as bad) not have them interested in spending more time with me, since I'm “just another annoying tourist”.This is much more true than the ridiculous idea that you can ever frustrate people as a language learner! How you act, and what you are generally saying is everything in a social interaction. The actual words coming out of your mouth (or their efficient conjugation etc.) are only a fraction of this.I shall continue onward in my attempt to learn these fascinating things that separate us and all the many more things that we have in common across different cultures. If I meet you in person some day, and act very strange it may be because I am in fact just very strange, but it may also be because my wires are crossed on which social norm I am supposed to be applying with your nationality – please don't take my personal quirky habits as an offense! I hope you'll forgive me if that happens, and be straight with me about it 😉Here is a viral video I made about the many things I've learned in 10 years travelling the world, you might enjoy it (you can read the article here: Top 10 life lessons learned in travelling the world 10 years.)Check it out, and share it (this link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RtGmqaM3Zo ) on your Facebook wall or otherwise, thanks!Social"", 'url': 'https://www.fluentin3months.com/strange-habits/', 'cleaned_text': ""The 23 strangest habits you’ll pick up after living in 23 different countries\nWhile I usually blog about language learning, I know a lot of you enjoy my travel and cultural updates as much or more.\nI've been travelling the world since 2003, but even forgetting the time involved, I have lived in twenty three countries (and counting); that's lived as in, spent at least a month (usually three, and over a year in some) in the country where I invested serious time into speaking its language (or already spoke its language on arrival) and tried to investigate its culture and made local friends. In that, I have acquired a lot of personal habits which to some might seem weird, annoying or strange. This post summarizes them all.\n\nCountries I've lived in: Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Belgium, Colombia, the US, Canada, Ireland, UK, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Egypt, Italy, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Turkey, India, the Philippines, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Australia (I've also visited Poland, Uruguay, Singapore, Austria, Slovakia, Norway, and Mexico for a few days or weeks, but definitely wouldn't consider myself to have lived in any of these and was more of a tourist, and I've had a flight transfer through a bunch other countries for a few hours, which I wouldn't count at all).\nI can point you to travelers who have been to many more countries than I have (most of whom have been travelling way less than I have, so it really shows the different speeds we travel at), but my style of travel and theirs is very different and I feel like I have gotten to know the modern cultures of each of these countries much more than the majority of passers-through ever do.\nThe thing about living in a country and truly attempting to understand its culture and language, is that you have to pick up a lot of their customs to stand out less and make them feel more comfortable. Some of these I have done only in passing and stopped almost immediately after leaving the country, but quite a few (as you'll see here) have stuck with me for life.\n\nIn today's post, I want to share a few of the strangest habits that I have picked up!\n1. Ask people if they want to have a shower way too often\n\nThis strange custom is one that I picked up from spending an entire year in Brazil.\nI travelled a lot in the country, and had my own home some of the time, but the rest of the time would stay with friends. It struck me as incredibly odd, but the first question Brazilians would ask me whenever I arrived at their home was always if I wanted to have a shower!\n\nThis wasn't saying anything about my B.O., but something that is customary to offer any guest who is visiting you in Brazil, including if they are not staying over. Brazil can be a hot country depending on the city and time of year, and Brazilians are among the most hygienic people I've ever come across, generally taking at least two and sometimes three showers a day, especially if they are physically active (gym, sports etc.)\n\nBecause of this, Brazilians generally want to have a shower as soon as they arrive at someone's house, to freshen up. The problem is that I'm so used to asking this that any time I have a Couchsurfer over at my place, or if it's a somewhat hot day anywhere in the world and someone pops by my house, I just automatically ask the question of if they want to hop in the shower as soon as they enter.\n\nYou can imagine the looks I've gotten from asking this when people think I'm somehow implying they are smelly, or a girl who may be just a friend or a very different age to me thinking I have an ulterior motive! I'm just trying to be nice, as any Brazilian would, I swear!\n\n2. Examine a business card or hand over money as if it were about to explode\n\nThis time, a habit I picked up in Taiwan, which stood out for me immediately after I arrived there, was that you treat anything that you can hand over to another person as sacred.\nSo if I meet you at a conference for instance, and you give me your business card, rather than glance at it and stuff it into my pocket, I will delicately accept it using both of my hands as if I'm holding a fragile piece of crystal and examine it closely for the incredible design, as if I was looking through a window into a wonderful parallel universe.\nOnly then can I put it into my left pocket, which is my “throw-into-the-bin-as-soon-as-they're-gone” pocket.\nAnd with money, the same rules apply. You don't hand over any note with one hand, but with two, as if it will explode if handled incorrectly. I have shaken off this second habit due to spending long enough outside of Asia by now, but I have to admit that I still feel quite insulted whenever someone hands me money with one hand without forcefully putting their whole body into the delicate transfer. I definitely still take business cards with both hands though.\n\n3. Point as if you're flirting with a fish\n\nIn the Philippines, and strangely enough also in Colombia and other countries, they almost never point with their index finger (thus immediately nullifying the very title of index finger). This is considered quite rude in many cultures.\n\nSo what do you do if you genuinely need to point to something? Why, you use your lips of course! You need to pout them as if you are making a kissy-face and do so in the direction of the thing that requires the attention of the conversation. It's not a long “point”, but more a quick pucker-up for a half a second.\n\nI got so used to this, that I do it unconsciously now, even when I'm also pointing with my fingers too. So I look weird to pretty much everyone now!\n\n4. Feel guilty about using the toilet\n\nThis is an odd one, but many countries in the world don't have the same kind of plumbing system as we do in Europe and North America.\nAs such, in many countries in Africa, South America and Asia, you can't flush toilet paper down the toilet!\nBecause of this, there is a bin beside the toilet for you to discard your “used” toilet paper. It seems disgusting at first to have that within sight, but after a while you get used to it. Now, I genuinely feel… guilty every time I flush toilet paper down the toilet itself, even when in a country where this is perfectly acceptable as the plumbing system can handle it, because I feel like I'm clogging up the pipes!\n\n5. Call people at random intervals and hang up before they answer\n\nAnother habit I picked up, this time from Italy is the concept of a “squillo”.\nYou may generally understand this as a missed call, although it is always intentional. We do this all the time in most countries if we want to give someone our number, by noting theirs and then calling them just for a second, and they'd see our number on their caller ID.\n\nItalians however take this to the next level and make it an entirely new form of communication! I wrote about it in detail here.\n\nBasically, you call someone and then hang up such that the context of why you called is obvious. If you are meeting up with them but will arrive 10 minutes late, the squillo implies that you are on your way. If you are going out with someone and not meeting up with them right now but receive a very quick call where they hang up before you would pick up, this means that they are thinking about you (lovers or married couples etc.) If a guy friend gives another guy friend a squillo, it essentially means “whats up?” and you would text him back.\n\nEssentially, you have these random moments throughout your day where your phone rings for just a second and then stops ringing. Now, the instinct of most non-Italians is to call this person back. Maybe it's their way of saying they are out of credit for instance, and it's urgent they talk to you. But the squillo itself was the communication; you have to extrapolate from the context what it means without calling them back!\n\nAs such, I call friends and hang up immediately all the time. In most countries though, they'll call me back and we have an awkward conversation, which I was attempting to avoid precisely by giving them a squillo! I still can't shake this habit.\n\n""}]","Many common ""weird habits"" are clinically recognized as Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs). These are not just quirks but complex actions often used to cope with stress or anxiety.

A primary example is onychophagia, or chronic nail-biting. While it may seem like a simple nervous habit, **statistics show that approximately 20-30% of the general population engages in it** (**Citation: The TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors**).

These behaviors often serve a psychological purpose. As psychologist Dr. Fred Penzel, an expert in BFRBs, explains, these actions are frequently ""attempts to regulate their emotional or sensory states."" They can be a way to self-soothe when a person feels over- or under-stimulated.

Other examples of BFRBs include skin-picking (dermatillomania) and hair-pulling (trichotillomania), which are recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)."
Should the US have a single-payer healthcare system?,"['intermediate', 'debate', 'health', 'non-technical', 'question', 'opinion', 'research', 'sensitive', 'informational']","[{'raw_text': 'Don R. McCanne, M.D.YES: Single payer insurance would provide better and more affordable care for everyone.Single payer national health insurance would resolve virtually all of the major problems facing America’s health care system today.Single payer insurance is commonly defined as a single government fund within each state which pays hospitals, physicians and other health care providers, replacing the current multi-payer system of private insurance companies and health plans. It would provide coverage for the 44 million who are uninsured. It would eliminate the financial threat and impaired access to care for the tens of millions who do have coverage but are unable to afford the out-of-pocket expenses because of deficiencies in their insurance plans. It would return to the patient free choice of physicians and hospitals, not just choice of restrictive health care plans. It would relieve businesses of administrative hassles and expenses of maintaining a health benefits program. It would remove from the health care equation the middleman - the insurance/managed care industry - that has wreaked havoc on the traditional patient-physician relationship, while diverting outrageous amounts of patient-care dollars to their own coffers. It would control health care inflation through constructive mechanisms of cost containment that improve allocation of our health care resources, rather than controlling costs through an impersonal business ethic that strips patients of care to improve the bottom line.In sum, single payer national health insurance would provide access to high quality care for everyone at an affordable price. Since this would be beneficial for individuals, businesses, and even the government, why don’t we have a national single payer plan? The reason: The political will has not developed because of lingering concerns over the alleged defects of such a proposal. These supposed defects have been publicized widely by those interests that for ideological, financial, or other self-serving reasons are opposed to it. Since the benefits are unimpeachable, we should look the claims of the plan’s critics.The first misgiving usually expressed is that we cannot afford to pay for comprehensive care for everyone. Every other industrialized nation provides comprehensive care to everyone at a much lower cost than our system that leaves so many out. Other nations spend 6 to 10 percent of their Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, whereas we, the wealthiest nation on earth, spend 14 percent of our GDP. We already have enough funds dedicated to health care to provide the highest quality of care for everyone. Studies conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, the Lewin Group and Boston University School of Public Health have shown that, under a single payer system, comprehensive care can be provided for everyone without spending any more funds than now are spent.There has been considerable publicity about the queue, or delays in receiving elective services that are characteristic of other nations, especially the United Kingdom and Canada. At 6 percent and 9 percent of their GDPs, respectively, they are spending much less than us and need only to increase their budgets to escape prolonged queues. Not only do we have more than sufficient funds, we also are a nation that is infamous for our excess capacity in health care. Typical of these excesses is the fact that there are more MRI scanners in Orange County, California, than in all of Canada. With our generous funding and the tremendous capacity of our health care delivery system, the queue will not be a significant limiting factor in the United States.“Americans do not want socialized medicine,” is a phrase that is frequently used glibly to dismiss the single payer concept. Socialized medicine is a system in which the government owns the facilities, and the providers of care are government employees. In sharp contrast, a single payer system uses the existing private and public sector health care delivery system, preserving private ownership and employment. The unique feature of a single payer system is that all health care risks are placed in a universal risk pool, covering everyone. The pool is funded in a fair and equitable manner such that everyone pays their fair share, unlike our current defective system in which some pay far too much, and others are not paying their share. The funds are allocated through a publicly administered program resulting in optimum use of our health care dollars. A single payer system has no more in common with socialized medicine than does our Medicare program.Many contend that government bureaucracies are very wasteful compared with the efficiencies of the private marketplace. In the health care arena, that just has not been true. Our Medicare program, a publicly administered program, operates on an administrative cost of less than 2 percent. The managed care intermediaries consume 9 to 30 percent of health care dollars. The difference is due to large corporate administrations, tremendous duplication of administrative efforts between companies and other intermediaries, and marketing expenses that would be superfluous in a public program. A single payer system has as its mission optimizing resources for better patient care. Funds are not wasted on corporate administrative excesses.It is argued that a single payer system, by being universal, would lower the standard of care to a level of mediocrity for everyone, preventing the affluent from exercising his or her option to obtain the highest level of care. However, our current system is characterized by essentially two alternatives: either no insurance with severely impaired access to even a mediocre level of care, or being insured by a managed care industry that has slashed and burned until mediocrity has become the standard. Only the relatively affluent now have access to unlimited care. With the generous level of funds that we already have dedicated to health care, with a more efficient administration, and with an exclusive mission of optimum patient care, a single payer system would raise the level of care well above the mediocrity that we now have. A single payer system does not preclude the affluent from paying, outside the system, for a penthouse suite in the hospital, or for cosmetic surgery, or for any other services that should not be part of a publicly funded program anyway.Other than the assurance that everyone would have coverage for health care, there is even a greater good that single payer would bring to our nation. Making available to everyone preventive and public health services would significantly improve the level of health of our entire nation. Reduction of communicable diseases and reducing the higher costs of untreated chronic disease helps all of us. Healthy individuals make for a healthier work force, with less lost time at work, greater productivity, and a more positive work environment.What are the current prospects for reform? Most proposals call for incremental and pluralistic measures. Unfortunately, such approaches cannot meet the goals of universal, comprehensive, affordable health care. As an example, it was recognized that Medicaid was grossly inadequate in meeting the needs of insurance coverage of low-income children. Congress passed the Children’s Health Insurance Program to expand the number of children covered. Yet, since enactment, the number of uninsured children actually has increased. Even if every eligible child could be enrolled, an impossible administrative task, in California alone, 600,000 children would still be left without coverage. Incrementalism will never provide universal coverage.Pluralistic approaches are popular with the organizations that advocate for them. For instance, the American Medical Association supports medical savings accounts, a scheme that will provide pools of funds for physicians to dip into without any restrictions on fees or controls on delivery of ineffective services. Although healthy individuals would find medical savings accounts to be attractive, those individuals would be exposed to financial risk should they develop a major medical problem, since the catastrophic plan that backs up the savings accounts would not cover the significant out-of-pocket expenses that would mount up after the savings funds are depleted. Another example is the governmental insurance premium subsidy proposed by the Health Insurance Association of America. This subsidy would divert more taxpayer dollars to an industry that is already wasting enough of our health care resources.Perhaps one of the more inhumane proposals is to offer uninsured patients discounts for cash payments and pass that off as health care reform. Such a scheme is merely a means of assuring physicians modest income from indigent patients, while dodging governmental and insurance company oversight. This simplistic plan not only exposes the uninsured to financial disaster should a major medical event occur, but it also significantly impairs access to even the most modest care simply because of lack of affordability. While the various pluralistic approaches would meet the needs of special interests, they can never provide adequate coverage and access for the most vulnerable members of our society.We should modernize the traditional insurance functions of risk pooling, administration and marketing, and information management. The insurance industry has been evading its most important function, risk pooling, by devising methods of passing risk on to providers and patients. We need to place everyone in the risk pool and then assure that the funding is fair by the adoption of a single payer model. Many billions of dollars could be returned to patient care each year by eliminating the expenses of plan marketing, and by modernizing administration through the creation of an efficient public system.Information management has been limited primarily to claims processing. Modernization of this potential tool can provide tremendous rewards in improving our health care system. Encrypted electronic medical records would enable 24-hour availability and portability of essential patient information. Use of a common record would reduce medical error by preventing conflicts and duplications in management. Improved collection of outcome data would provide a rational basis for increasing efficiency through better allocation of our resources. With the efficiencies and power of information technology, we finally have the potential to deliver on the previously elusive promise of higher quality health care at a lower cost through an electronically integrated health care system.Would Americans accept a publicly administered health insurance program? For over three decades, they have shown strong support for a national health insurance program for our seniors, Medicare. Americans across the political spectrum emphatically reject suggestions that Medicare should be abolished, although they do support needed reform. If we had a comprehensive, affordable health insurance program that covered everyone, Americans would finally be able to say, quite honestly and with justifiable pride, “We have the finest health care system on earth.”Robert LeBow, M.D., Immediate Past President of Physicians for a National Health Program contributed to this article.Don R.

Gavin Newsom has named a state commission to find ways to achieve universal coverage, possibly through a single-payer system, and as the Democratic presidential candidates are debating “Medicare for All” proposals on the national stage.The U.S. spends more on healthcare than any other country, yet is one of only a few developed nations that does not provide universal coverage. Under proposed single payer bills, such as “Medicare for All,” a unified public financing system would replace private insurance, similar to the healthcare system in Canada and many other wealthy nations.To estimate what would happen if the United States adopted a single-payer system, researchers from UCSF, UCLA and UC Berkeley examined 22 economic analyses by government, business and academic organizations of national and state-level single payer plans, including proposals made in Massachusetts, California, Maryland, Vermont, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New York and Oregon.These analyses were used by policymakers to evaluate the proposals, estimating savings the plans would create through simplified billing and lower drug costs while also taking into account increases in health spending that would arise as newly insured people sought healthcare.The researchers found that 19 of the 22 models predicted net savings in the first year after implementation, averaging 3.5 percent of total healthcare spending.The researchers were able to estimate longer-term savings by using cost projections made in 10 of the models, which looked as far as 11 years into the future. These studies assumed that savings would grow over time, as the increases in healthcare utilization by the newly insured leveled off, and the global budgets adopted by single-payer systems helped to constrain costs. By the 10th year, all modeled single payer systems would save money, even those that projected costs would initially increase.“Even though they start with different single designs and modeling assumptions, the vast majority of these studies all come to the same conclusion,” said James G. Kahn, MD, MPH, a professor in the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and a member of the Philip R. Lee Health Policy Institute. “This suggests that fears that a single-payer system would increase costs are likely misplaced.”Savings from simplified payment administration and reductions in drug prices and other efficiencies ranged from 3 to 27 percent, with the largest savings found in plans that lowered drug costs.Higher initial costs were associated with plans that had low co-pays or none at all, offered rich benefits, or that did not expect savings from lower drug and medical equipment costs.This means that across the political spectrum, there is near consensus among these economists that a single-payer system would save money.The models were created by analysts from different political perspectives, and they provided a range of cost estimates in the first year of operation, from 7 percent higher to 15 percent lower.The researchers found that the economic models that were supported by left-leaning funders or that were done by academics found slightly larger net savings. But analyses supported by more conservative funders or performed outside of academia still predicted single-payer systems would yield savings.“This means that across the political spectrum, there is near consensus among these economists that a single-payer system would save money,” said Christopher Cai, a third-year medical student at UCSF and the study’s first author. “Replacing private insurance with a public system is essential to achieving these savings.”Authors: Christopher Cai, Jackson Runte, Isabel Ostrer, Kacey Berry, Justin White, PhD, and James G.

Under proposed single payer bills, such as “Medicare for All,” a unified public financing system would replace private insurance, similar to the healthcare system in Canada and many other wealthy nations.\n\nTo estimate what would happen if the United States adopted a single-payer system, researchers from UCSF, UCLA and UC Berkeley examined 22 economic analyses by government, business and academic organizations of national and state-level single payer plans, including proposals made in Massachusetts, California, Maryland, Vermont, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New York and Oregon.\nThese analyses were used by policymakers to evaluate the proposals, estimating savings the plans would create through simplified billing and lower drug costs while also taking into account increases in health spending that would arise as newly insured people sought healthcare.\nThe researchers found that 19 of the 22 models predicted net savings in the first year after implementation, averaging 3.5 percent of total healthcare spending.\nThe researchers were able to estimate longer-term savings by using cost projections made in 10 of the models, which looked as far as 11 years into the future. These studies assumed that savings would grow over time, as the increases in healthcare utilization by the newly insured leveled off, and the global budgets adopted by single-payer systems helped to constrain costs. By the 10th year, all modeled single payer systems would save money, even those that projected costs would initially increase.\n\n“Even though they start with different single designs and modeling assumptions, the vast majority of these studies all come to the same conclusion,” said James G. Kahn, MD, MPH, a professor in the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and a member of the Philip R. Lee Health Policy Institute. “This suggests that fears that a single-payer system would increase costs are likely misplaced.”\n\nSavings from simplified payment administration and reductions in drug prices and other efficiencies ranged from 3 to 27 percent, with the largest savings found in plans that lowered drug costs.\nHigher initial costs were associated with plans that had low co-pays or none at all, offered rich benefits, or that did not expect savings from lower drug and medical equipment costs.\nThis means that across the political spectrum, there is near consensus among these economists that a single-payer system would save money.\nThe models were created by analysts from different political perspectives, and they provided a range of cost estimates in the first year of operation, from 7 percent higher to 15 percent lower.\nThe researchers found that the economic models that were supported by left-leaning funders or that were done by academics found slightly larger net savings. But analyses supported by more conservative funders or performed outside of academia still predicted single-payer systems would yield savings.\n\n“This means that across the political spectrum, there is near consensus among these economists that a single-payer system would save money,” said Christopher Cai, a third-year medical student at UCSF and the study’s first author. “Replacing private insurance with a public system is essential to achieving these savings.”\n\nAuthors: Christopher Cai, Jackson Runte, Isabel Ostrer, Kacey Berry, Justin White, PhD, and James G.

However, most of my friends (and I suspect most Americans) wonder exactly what single payer healthcare is and how will it affect them. In a New England Journal of Medicine perspective piece, Jonathan Oberlander, PhD, a professor of social medicine at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, expounds on the history and obstacles facing calls for single payer healthcare reform.Problems with the current U.S. healthcare systemOberlander points out that the impetus for reorganizing the entire healthcare system has to do with the regrettable state of healthcare in the United States. Currently, the healthcare finance structure is made of an impressively complicated network of multiple payers, involving both private and government health insurance options. Despite spending more on healthcare than comparable countries, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy and performs poorly on a variety of health outcomes.

Universal health coverage would be a major step towards equality, especially for uninsured and underinsured Americans. Overall expenses and wasteful spending could be better controlled through cost control and lower administrative costs, as evidenced in other countries. Furthermore, a single payer system has more incentive to direct healthcare spending toward public health measures. For example, targeting funding towards childhood obesity prevention programs in elementary schools and daycares reduces the rates and complications of obesity more effectively and at lower costs than paying for doctor visits to recommend healthier diets and increased physical activity.At the same time, we must also recognize the potential tradeoffs of transitioning to a single payer system. Lengthy wait times and restricted availability of certain healthcare services (such as elective surgery or cosmetic procedures) are important criticisms.

Public Mental HealthVolume 6 - 2021 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.627560Values-Based Foundation for a U.S. Single Payer Health System Model- School of Health Professions, School of Nursing, Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, United StatesA universal, single payer model for the American health system aligns with and should emanate from commonly held values contained within the country’s foundational religious teachings, morals, ethics and democratic heritage. The Affordable Care Act in its attempt to create expanded health access has met with significant challenges. The conservative Supreme Court decreases the likelihood of a federal mandated single payer model. As uncertainty of the structure of the healthcare system increases, this paper supports its transformation to a single payer model. Healthcare should be considered a duty within the framework of a Kantian approach to ethics and a social good. Evidently ignoring this duty, the American health system perpetuates a healthcare underclass, with underserved portions of the population, with unequal access to quality care and persistent health status and outcome disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the effect of social determinants on optimal health outcome. A health insurance system based on the nation’s commonly held values has the potential to eliminate these disparities.IntroductionA health system can be compared to a symphony, in which all musicians harmoniously work together to a common goal. By contrast, the United States (U.S.) health system is more like a cacophony of sounds. Discordance emanates from its pluralism of for-profit, not-for profit, faith-based and municipal providers, regulators and payers. Each competes to benefit respective positions rather than common goals. It has resulted in comparatively more expense, with poorer and disparate population health status and outcomes. Even with the changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act [ACA], approximately one in five privately insured individuals say they skip needed care because of cost, while larger shares of Americans particularly those with high deductible plans have experienced some form of financial strain paying for care. More than 70% of Americans say that the U.S. healthcare e system needs either “fundamental changes” or to be “completely rebuilt.” (Mound, 2018).With a single payer model all have the same access to the same services and providers are paid the same for the same service. Premiums to insurance companies would be replaced by a taxing system (Seidman, 2015). The model fulfills the World Health Organization’s Declaration of Alma, challenging society to provide health care as a right (World Health Organization, 1978).Disparities Within the Current U.S. Health SystemThe elimination of health disparities and the achievement of health equity appears as an overarching goal within the framework of the latest iteration of the Department of Health Services’ Healthy People (2030) (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2020a). This has appeared as an overarching goal within multiple Healthy People decennial iterations (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 1996; United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2015; United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2020b). Despite the inclusion of the elimination of health disparities and the achievement of health equity as an overarching goal for the nation for decades, health disparities remain all too evident and in some instances have grown even larger. Currently still, there is a health care underclass where lower income groups and racial/ethnic minorities do not have equal access to care (Artiga et al., 2020), with resultant evident disparities related to such health status indicators, as life expectancy at birth, infant mortality and preterm births (National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). Non-Hispanic Caucasian women have the lowest infant mortality rate of 4.63 (per 1,000 live births), compared to 4.86 Hispanics, and 10.75 for non-Hispanic Black women.Controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) there are evident disparities by race and ethnicity. Even when other factors are comparable, marginalized racial and ethnic populations tend to receive care that is of lower quality. Non-Hispanic Black males have the highest cancer mortality rate, 16% higher than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and double that of male Asian or Pacific Islanders. Black males’ prostate cancer mortality rate is more than twice that of the other racial/ethnic groups. Black females have a breast cancer mortality rate 40% higher than NHW females, although their rates of incidence are similar for the two groups.Life expectancy disparities based on income are striking. At the age of forty (40), men whose income was at the lowest 1% level had an expected death age of 72.7 years. Men at the highest 1% income level had an expected death age nearly fifteen (15) years greater (87.3 years). For women at the age of forty (40) at the lowest compared to the highest income levels, the difference was approximately ten (10) years, i.e. 78.8 and 88.9 respectively (Chetty et al., 2016).Fiscella and Sanders found the uninsured have much lower rates of receiving preventive care. African Americans and Latinos have lower rates of cancer screening, most evident with the uninsured (Fiscella and Sanders, 2016). “Significant disparities by race and ethnicity are seen in quality of care for chronic disease control.” This includes poorer control of blood pressure, blood sugar and LDL cholesterol levels. Minority patients are hospitalized and re-hospitalized at higher rates. African Americans and Latinos use mental health and substance abuse services far less than Whites do.Powell (Powell, 2016) asserted that it was extremely difficult to disentangle health inequality from so many other barrier-creating social determinants, such as income, education, housing and geography, as well as immutable factors such as race and gender. In many instances establishing cause vs. effect is likewise difficult to discern. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted social inequity and lower quality of care experienced by racial and ethnically diverse individuals, even when access-related factors, such as patients’ insurance status and income, are controlled. Moreover, health systems payer models, as well as the legal regulatory, and policy environment in which they operate, may have disparate and negative effects on minorities’ ability to attain quality care (Institute of Medicine, 2003).Inconsistent ACA implementation among states has perpetuated disparate access to health insurance. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled each state could determine whether they would expand Medicaid financial eligibility for its citizens from those earning at or below the federal poverty level up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Following the ruling fourteen states opted out of the financial eligibility expansion. It was estimated as result of that decision, that 3.6 million fewer people would be covered by Medicaid. It was further estimated that states could lose $8.4 billion in federal transfer payments and state spending for uncompensated care could increase by $1 billion in the ensuing four years (Price and Eibner, 2013). The inconsistent implementation of ACA created what some have labeled a coverage gap in states which opted not to expand Medicaid financial eligibility up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Resultant uninsured populations were concentrated in the southern states of Texas, Florida and Georgia, with 25%, 18% and 10% respectively. Hispanics/Latinos have an uninsured rate that is three times that of Whites and for Blacks the rate is double the White rate (Texas Health Institute, 2016).Comparable Single Payer Health SystemsThere is marked heterogeneity among single payer health system models. Denmark, Sweden, Australia, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and Canada are example of 12 high income countries with single payer financing of health care. Countries vary in terms of the extent to which regional or national government exert financial and regulatory control. They also differ in terms of the scope of health coverage, hospital ownership, innovative technological adoption, budgetary regulationsand degree of financial cost to the insured.Managing healthcare exclusively at a federal level, such as Medicare, without regional control (Medicaid) is a rarity seen only in the Netherlands, France, Singapore and Taiwan. Out of pocket expenditures are highest among federal single payer models. For example, in Singapore, 69% of constituents have private health insurance and 61% of total health expenditures are paid by consumers. One may argue with the exception of France, these countries do not compare in size to the American Health System (Glied et al., 2019). When looking at France only 7% of the total health expenditures are paid by consumers but 95% of the population has private insurance. France spends less than half of per capita expenditures than the United States. Life expectancy in France is four years higher (78 years vs. 82); rehospitalization rates over 65 is 5% lower (14.7 vs. 20); infant mortality is lower (3.5 vs. 5.7%). The French system is government financed not government administered and given to its residents at birth. Called “social security” its focus is preventative care.In countries where regional governments administrate health care under national policy, the percentage of out of pocket expenditures is twice the rate of France at about 14%–15%. Canada, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland apply this model. The rate of private health insurance range from 10% to 29% in these models except for Canada. Sixty-seven percent of Canadians have private health insurance. The Canadian system has a narrow set of basic federal benefits with comprehensive care covered by the regional provinces. The Canadian system has no cost sharing to the consumer. The Canadian model approximates Medicare and Medicaid for all.With the exception of Taiwan, the high-income countries with moderate cost sharing have embraced UHC (UHC) for its population with at least a significant portion of the population purchasing supplemental private insurance to pay for uncovered services.Systems of universal coverage vary, using a combination of taxes, premium payments and cost sharing. Almost all have a role for the private health insurance sector (Tikkanen, 2019). In contrast, the United States, spent 17.0 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health care. This spending represents almost twice the average among the 12 nations listed, with the poorest health outcomes including lowest life expectancy, highest suicide rate, highest prevalence of chronic diseases, highest number of preventable hospitalizations and highest rate of avoidable deaths (Tikkanen and Abrams, 2020).In countries with cost sharing the United States still demonstrates poor health status indicators related to expenditures. Life expectancy in years is lowest (Switzerland, 83.6, Norway, 82.7 years; Canada, 82.0; U.S. 78.6.). Suicide rates is highest per 100,000 population (U.S. 13.9; Canada, 11.8; Norway, 11.6; Switzerland, 11.2). Chronic disease burden percentage in the population is highest (U.S: 28%; Canada, 22%; Norway, 16%; Switzerland, 15%) Avoidable death rates per 100,000 population is highest (U.S. 112; Germany, 86; Canada, 72; Switzerland 54).Pandemic & Universal Health CoverageA study during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that countries with universal health coverage (UHC) had a case fatality rate of 10.5% compared to 4.9% for countries without UHC (Lee et al., 2021). Although these statistics were stark, in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic the results were attributed to prolonged wait times and allocation of life sustaining treatments to health care professionals. The fatality rate belies the fact that countries with UHC had lower case numbers of patients.Recent literature illustrates the public health benefit of UHC to primary care; particularly vaccination. Dongawar and colleague (Dongarwar and Salihu, 2021) illustrated that among 47 countries that initiated COVID-19 vaccination by January 2021 more than half had UHC with a statistically significant (p-value < 0.5) early vaccination rate of 1.55% for nations with UHC vs. 0.51% for nations without UHC. An uncoordinated effort in the U.S. led to a vaccination rate of 2.82% which when compared to Denmark at 2.02% was higher but Israel had the highest vaccination rate of greater than 22%. Isreal’s health expenditures are also only 7% of GDP more than 50% less than the American percentage of GDP (Clarfield et al., 2017). Their UHC is funded through taxes and as the other aforementioned UHC health systems have public options with supplementary private coverage. Although the size of the nation is comparable to New York State, hospitals remain government owned and costs are constrained by governmental control.Taiwan in particular demonstrated a profound proactive preventive approach to COVID-19. Taiwan with an increased population density and close proximity to Wuhan China experienced an incident rate of 20.7 cases per million compared to just New York State alone at 39.1 cases per million in april 2020. Perhaps the message of providing for public health led to Taiwan’s strategic priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic which included national public health agencies, investing in infrastructure and improving public health workforce. In the United States, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic health outcomes diminished for those with co-morbid and underlying conditions without health insurance. Despite the ACA, an estimated additional 5.4 million Americans lacked health insurance due to loss of employment during COVID-19. Medicare/Medical for All seeks to expand public benefits with suggestion of the elimination of private payors. Yet as discussed, comparable health systems with federally mandated systems expand access to all through supplementary private health insurance and cost-sharing. To strategically improve the American health system, foundational ethical and moral philosophies have implications to aid the adoption of universal health care.Ethical/Moral Values as Foundational for the Health SystemImmanuel Kant’s categorical imperative includes two types of duties within his ethical and moral philosophy. There are positive duties, which include actions we are commanded to take and there are negative actions which are prohibited. Kant assumes that people are rational and have choices, which selected are to be based on rationality and duty (Yudanin, 2015). “The primacy of duty is affirmed in Kantian ethics. In true sense the moral worth of a person is revealed only when he acts from duty. Actions qualify as moral when they are worthy and enacted upon for the sake of duty (Mulia et al., 2016). Actions should be taken because they are inherently good onto themselves and not a means to achieve something else (Foot, 1972). Promoting access and health equality can be viewed as a positive duty, a moral action, a good onto itself within Kant’s categorical imperative.According to a deontological philosophy actions are morally acceptable when consistent with relevant moral norms. In the case of universal health care in America, strategically adopting the norms of health systems with equitable health outcomes should be the duty of legislators. What should serve as the moral norms; what is right and what is wrong; what is a duty and obligation? Ross’ duties for pluralistic deontology assists in answering these questions. Consider their connectivity to foundational values:1) Duties deriving from our own previous acts or actions: a) keeping promises, be they explicit or implicit.2) Duties of justice … they guarantee that people can get what they deserve.3) Duties of beneficence, which rest on the mere fact that there are other beings in the world whose condition we can make better in respect of virtue, or of intelligence, or of pleasure …4) Non-maleficence, ensuring that no harm occurs to the ill, the infirmed the disenfranchized (Craig, 2014)Craig (King, 2006) considered health care to be a social good, based on the tenets of religion, American ideals, morality and ethics for the foundations for the health system. The author challenges Americans to get away from looking in the mirror as the wicked witch did in Snow White. Americans are really not the “fairest of them all.” In looking in the mirror Americans must evaluate who we really are as a society what we should be, using our values to provide directionality as we struggle to provide a more rational, a more just health system. Dr Martin Luther King Jr reminded the nation, soon after the 1964 Civil Rights Law and the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, there was more to be done when he proclaimed: “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.” (Meadowcroft, 2015) The provision of healthcare as a means of providing life, liberty and access to should not be determined by market forces.Duty, Morality and Commitment to OthersFriedberg (Friedberg, 2013) points to the Jewish philosopher Maimonides who wrote about the mitsvat aseh, representing an absolute obligation. The term mitzvah refers to such an obligation or commandment in Hebrew writings. While we are commanded or are obliged to perform mitzvot, when done we are blessed. Performing mitzvot provides the performer with recompense which should not be viewed as monetary reward. Biblical references to the blessings that will accrue if mitzvot are performed can be found for example in Leviticus 26: 3–12; Deuteronomy 7: 12–24; Deuteronomy11: 22–25; and Matthew 7: 24.Tzedakah, is a related Hebrew term for the commandment associated with charity, which has the literal meaning of righteousness or justice. Consider the following capturing the essence of this mitzvah of tzedakah from Rabbenu Bachya Ben Asher, a 13th century Torah commentator:“justice shall be pursued whether to one's profit or loss, whether in words or an action, whether to Jews or non-Jews. Hence we are not to wait for the right opportunity, the right time, and the right place to come along, but instead we are to actively seek the opportunity to practice justice. As a matter of simple justice, we are duty-bound to help others in need”. (Taitz, 2007).Complementary Values Support a Single Payer ModelA review of common ethical, moral and religious teachings, foundational to the nation’s heritage appear to support a single payer model. Inherent in such a model are values contained within the Golden Rule, a sense of community and responsibilities for those within the community, a responsibility to help those in need, compassion, justice and doing the right things. appropriately labeled health care as a social good.A single payer system embodies these values. Its success is dependent on the public’s acceptance of two complementary principles: “1) subsidies for individuals who are too poor or too sick to acquire insuranc, and 2) compulsion (i.e. a mandate) for everyone else to participate and implicitly contribute to the subsidies. The United States could achieve universal coverage relatively promptly if it were willing to adopt these 2 principles.” (Fuchs, 2018) The two principles are evidently compatible with religious, ethical, and moral tenets.Barriers and Opposition to Policy ChangeUnfortunately, as political polarity is reality, opposing sides ascribe mean-spirited attributes to their opponents. The following quote exemplifies this sentiment; “Some liberals presume that the sole motivation behind conservative resistance to UHC is crass selfishness. I have mine and you don’t.” Some conservatives view a movement toward universal coverage as “a power grab by ‘takers’ whose only motivation is to enjoy a free ride.” (Craig, 1984).ACA, as first envisioned, supported an expansion of Medicaid financial eligibility in all states. However, opposition to this goal led to opposition and eventual change to permit states to opt out of expansion. Nineteen states initially opted out of Medicaid resulting in a “coverage gap” for many. While there was a nation-wide sharp reduction in the uninsured population, the reduction in the uninsured could have been higher with all states agreeing to the expansion. Those in the coverage gap who remained uninsured most often had income too low to qualify for tax credits but too high to receive Medicaid because their states did not expand financial eligibility (Texas Health Institute, 2016).Perhaps the barrier to policy change is that some believe in a Social Darwinism approach of survival of the fittest. It is not the function of government to do everything. Instead government should care for those who are strong, with the hope that others through their ambition and with charity can do the rest. Society will benefit if the rich are made richer “and what falls from the table will be enough for the middle class … the wagon train will not make it to the Frontier unless some of the old, some of the young, some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail.” (Cuomo, 1984).Perhaps the barrier to policy change is a belief that not all are equal. Consider the transition evident in Orwell’s Animal Farm, in its “Seven Commandments” which went from “All animals are equal” to “All Animals are Equal but Some Animals are More Equal than Others.” (Bloom, 2009) Consider disparate access to care and health outcomes in the nation.Perhaps the barrier to policy change is the belief there are not enough resources for everyone to obtain all the health care that is needed and desired. Bauzon (Bauzon, 2015) asserts it is not possible for everyone to have the right to the best basic care. There is not enough of it to be distributed to everyone. What then should be the ethical and moral bases for rationing? Perhaps the barrier to policy change emanates from a manifestation of an us-versus-them attitude. Related, Pilkington (Pilkington, 2016) employs an us/we-versus the/them approach with regard to medicine. We intimately care for our own health and for those we care about the most. We should be treated congruent with how we would treat ourselves.ConclusionA denial of membership as “one of us,” is antithetical to the foundational values that have been discussed in this paper. If the value of equal justice for all is upheld, health care cannot be divided into haves and have nots. However, the current U.S. health system supports precisely that. There is a health care underclass, in which some are unable to access equal, high quality care, with resultant health status disparities, in conflict with the nation’s democratic values and underlying religious moral and ethical foundations. The rhetoric from the nation’s Presidents and other political leaders are often congruent with these foundations, and yet the current health system is not reflective of these.The goal of a single payer system provides a pathway to health reform with a values’ foundation. A single payer system permits equal access to the same quality of care, where everyone has “the same card,” and is congruent with the foundational values discussed in this paper.Author ContributionsIn the aftermath of the year 2020, certainties arose that the U.S Health system when challenged by a national pandemic does not provide equal health care access and outcomes for all citizens. The COVID pandemic demonstrated the effect of social determinants on optimal health outcomes. There is a dawning after the election of a new presidential team. During the uncertainty of the future structure of the U.S. health insurance system, this paper provides bases to support its transformation to a single payer model. Utilizing bioethical philosophy and principles, this paper proposes that health care should be considered “a duty within the framework of a Kantian approach to ethics” and a “social good.” A health insurance system based on the nation’s commonly held values has the potential to eliminate these disparities.

The Affordable Care Act in its attempt to create expanded health access has met with significant challenges. The conservative Supreme Court decreases the likelihood of a federal mandated single payer model. As uncertainty of the structure of the healthcare system increases, this paper supports its transformation to a single payer model. Healthcare should be considered a duty within the framework of a Kantian approach to ethics and a social good. Evidently ignoring this duty, the American health system perpetuates a healthcare underclass, with underserved portions of the population, with unequal access to quality care and persistent health status and outcome disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the effect of social determinants on optimal health outcome. A health insurance system based on the nation’s commonly held values has the potential to eliminate these disparities.\n\nIntroduction\nA health system can be compared to a symphony, in which all musicians harmoniously work together to a common goal. By contrast, the United States (U.S.) health system is more like a cacophony of sounds. Discordance emanates from its pluralism of for-profit, not-for profit, faith-based and municipal providers, regulators and payers. Each competes to benefit respective positions rather than common goals. It has resulted in comparatively more expense, with poorer and disparate population health status and outcomes. Even with the changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act [ACA], approximately one in five privately insured individuals say they skip needed care because of cost, while larger shares of Americans particularly those with high deductible plans have experienced some form of financial strain paying for care. More than 70% of Americans say that the U.S. healthcare e system needs either “fundamental changes” or to be “completely rebuilt.” (Mound, 2018).\n\nWith a single payer model all have the same access to the same services and providers are paid the same for the same service. Premiums to insurance companies would be replaced by a taxing system (Seidman, 2015). The model fulfills the World Health Organization’s Declaration of Alma, challenging society to provide health care as a right (World Health Organization, 1978).\n\nDisparities Within the Current U.S. Health System\nThe elimination of health disparities and the achievement of health equity appears as an overarching goal within the framework of the latest iteration of the Department of Health Services’ Healthy People (2030) (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2020a). This has appeared as an overarching goal within multiple Healthy People decennial iterations (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 1996; United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2015; United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2020b). Despite the inclusion of the elimination of health disparities and the achievement of health equity as an overarching goal for the nation for decades, health disparities remain all too evident and in some instances have grown even larger. Currently still, there is a health care underclass where lower income groups and racial/ethnic minorities do not have equal access to care (Artiga et al., 2020), with resultant evident disparities related to such health status indicators, as life expectancy at birth, infant mortality and preterm births (National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). Non-Hispanic Caucasian women have the lowest infant mortality rate of 4.63 (per 1,000 live births), compared to 4.86 Hispanics, and 10.75 for non-Hispanic Black women.\n\nControlling for socioeconomic status (SES) there are evident disparities by race and ethnicity. Even when other factors are comparable, marginalized racial and ethnic populations tend to receive care that is of lower quality. Non-Hispanic Black males have the highest cancer mortality rate, 16% higher than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and double that of male Asian or Pacific Islanders. Black males’ prostate cancer mortality rate is more than twice that of the other racial/ethnic groups. Black females have a breast cancer mortality rate 40% higher than NHW females, although their rates of incidence are similar for the two groups.\n\nLife expectancy disparities based on income are striking. At the age of forty (40), men whose income was at the lowest 1% level had an expected death age of 72.7 years. Men at the highest 1% income level had an expected death age nearly fifteen (15) years greater (87.3 years). For women at the age of forty (40) at the lowest compared to the highest income levels, the difference was approximately ten (10) years, i.e. 78.8 and 88.9 respectively (Chetty et al., 2016).\n\nFiscella and Sanders found the uninsured have much lower rates of receiving preventive care. African Americans and Latinos have lower rates of cancer screening, most evident with the uninsured (Fiscella and Sanders, 2016). “Significant disparities by race and ethnicity are seen in quality of care for chronic disease control.” This includes poorer control of blood pressure, blood sugar and LDL cholesterol levels. Minority patients are hospitalized and re-hospitalized at higher rates. African Americans and Latinos use mental health and substance abuse services far less than Whites do.\n\nPowell (Powell, 2016) asserted that it was extremely difficult to disentangle health inequality from so many other barrier-creating social determinants, such as income, education, housing and geography, as well as immutable factors such as race and gender. In many instances establishing cause vs. effect is likewise difficult to discern. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted social inequity and lower quality of care experienced by racial and ethnically diverse individuals, even when access-related factors, such as patients’ insurance status and income, are controlled. Moreover, health systems payer models, as well as the legal regulatory, and policy environment in which they operate, may have disparate and negative effects on minorities’ ability to attain quality care (Institute of Medicine, 2003).\n\nInconsistent ACA implementation among states has perpetuated disparate access to health insurance. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled each state could determine whether they would expand Medicaid financial eligibility for its citizens from those earning at or below the federal poverty level up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Following the ruling fourteen states opted out of the financial eligibility expansion. It was estimated as result of that decision, that 3.6 million fewer people would be covered by Medicaid. It was further estimated that states could lose $8.4 billion in federal transfer payments and state spending for uncompensated care could increase by $1 billion in the ensuing four years (Price and Eibner, 2013). The inconsistent implementation of ACA created what some have labeled a coverage gap in states which opted not to expand Medicaid financial eligibility up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Resultant uninsured populations were concentrated in the southern states of Texas, Florida and Georgia, with 25%, 18% and 10% respectively. Hispanics/Latinos have an uninsured rate that is three times that of Whites and for Blacks the rate is double the White rate (Texas Health Institute, 2016).\n\nComparable Single Payer Health Systems\nThere is marked heterogeneity among single payer health system models. Denmark, Sweden, Australia, England, France\n\n'}]","The debate over a single-payer healthcare system in the US involves balancing universal access against concerns about cost and implementation.

Proponents argue it would control costs and guarantee coverage for all citizens. The U.S. currently has the highest healthcare spending globally, consuming **17.8% of its GDP in 2021**, yet lags behind peer nations in health outcomes (**Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD**).

As health policy expert Dr. Steffie Woolhandler states, a single-payer system could ""rechannel the hundreds of billions of dollars wasted on private insurance bureaucracy to patient care.""

Opponents, however, raise concerns about potential for long wait times for specialized procedures, higher taxes, and a reduction in private-sector innovation.

The discussion aligns with the **World Health Organization (WHO)**'s push for universal health coverage, but its implementation in the U.S. would require navigating significant political and economic challenges."
Did a concept of human rights exist in the ancient world?,"['intermediate', 'informational', 'history', 'non-technical', 'question', 'fact', 'non-sensitive', 'research']","[{'raw_text': 'AShort History of Human RightsThe beliefthat everyone, by virtue of heror his humanity, is entitled tocertain human rights is fairlynew. Its roots, however, lie inearlier tradition and documentsof many cultures; it took thecatalyst of World War II to propelhuman rights onto the global stageand into the global conscience.Throughout much of history, people acquiredrights and responsibilities through their membership ina group a family, indigenous nation, religion, class,community, or state. Most societies have had traditionssimilar to the ""golden rule"" of ""Do untoothers as you would have them do unto you."" The HinduVedas, the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the Bible, theQuran (Koran), and the Analects of Confucius are five ofthe oldest written sources which address questions of peoplesduties, rights, and responsibilities. In addition, the Incaand Aztec codes of conduct and justice and an Iroquois Constitutionwere Native American sources that existed well before the18th century. In fact, all societies, whether in oral orwritten tradition, have had systems of propriety and justiceas well as ways of tending to the health and welfare oftheir members.Precursors of 20th CenturyHuman Rights DocumentsDocuments asserting individual rights,such the Magna Carta (1215), the English Bill of Rights(1689), the French Declaration on the Rights of Man andCitizen (1789), and the US Constitution and Bill of Rights(1791) are the written precursors to many of todayshuman rights documents. Yet many of these documents, whenoriginally translated into policy, excluded women, peopleof color, and members of certain social, religious, economic,and political groups. Nevertheless, oppressed people throughoutthe world have drawn on the principles these documents expressto support revolutions that assert the right to self-determination.Contemporary international human rightslaw and the establishment of the United Nations (UN) haveimportant historical antecedents. Efforts in the 19th centuryto prohibit the slave trade and to limit the horrors ofwar are prime examples. In 1919, countries established theInternationalLabor Organization (ILO) to oversee treatiesprotecting workers with respect to their rights, includingtheir health and safety. Concern over the protection ofcertain minority groups was raised by the League of Nationsat the end of the First World War. However, this organizationfor international peace and cooperation, created by thevictorious European allies, never achieved its goals. TheLeague floundered because the United States refused to joinand because the League failed to prevent Japans invasionof China and Manchuria (1931) and Italys attack onEthiopia (1935). It finally died with the onset of the SecondWorld War (1939).The Birth of the UnitedNationsThe idea of human rights emerged strongerafter World War II. The extermination by Nazi Germany ofover six million Jews, Sinti and Romani (gypsies), homosexuals,and persons with disabilities horrified the world.

The calls came from acrossthe globe for human rights standards to protect citizensfrom abuses by their governments, standards against whichnations could be held accountable for the treatment of thoseliving within their borders. These voices played a criticalrole in the San Francisco meeting that drafted the UnitedNations Charter in 1945.The Universal Declarationof Human RightsMemberstates of the UnitedNations pledged to promote respect for the human rightsof all. To advance this goal, the UN established a Commissionon Human Rights and charged it with the taskof drafting a document spelling out the meaning of the fundamentalrights and freedoms proclaimed in the Charter. The Commission,guided by Eleanor Roosevelts forceful leadership,captured the worlds attention.On December 10, 1948, the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adoptedby the 56 members of the United Nations. The vote was unanimous,although eight nations chose to abstain.The UDHR, commonly referred to as theinternational Magna Carta, extended the revolution in internationallaw ushered in by the United Nations Charter namely,that how a government treats its own citizens is now a matterof legitimate international concern, and not simply a domesticissue.

Althougha declarationis not a legally binding document, the Universal Declarationhas achieved the status of customaryinternational law because people regard it ""asa common standard of achievement for all people and allnations.""The Human Rights CovenantsWith the goal of establishing mechanismsfor enforcing the UDHR, the UN Commission on Human Rightsproceeded to draft two treaties:the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) and its optional Protocoland the International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights (ICESCR). Together with the Universal Declaration,they are commonly referred to as the InternationalBill of Human Rights. The ICCPR focuses on suchissues as the right to life, freedom of speech, religion,and voting. The ICESCR focuses on such issues as food, education,health, and shelter. Both covenantstrumpet the extension of rights to all persons and prohibitdiscrimination.As of 1997, over 130 nations have ratifiedthese covenants. The United States, however, has ratifiedonly the ICCPR, and even that with many reservations, orformal exceptions, to its full compliance. (See FromConcept to Convention: How Human Rights Law Evolves).Subsequent Human RightsDocumentsIn addition to the covenants in theInternational Bill of Human Rights, the United Nations hasadopted more than 20 principal treaties further elaboratinghuman rights. These include conventions to prevent and prohibitspecific abuses like torture and genocideand to protect especially vulnerable populations, such asrefugees (Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees,1951), women (Conventionon the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen, 1979), and children (Conventionon the Rights of the Child, 1989). As of 1997the United States has ratified only these conventions:The Convention on the Eliminationof All Forms of Racial DiscriminationThe Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of the Crime of GenocideThe Convention on the Political Rightsof WomenThe Slavery Convention of 1926The Convention against Torture andOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or PunishmentIn Europe, the Americas, and Africa,regional documents for the protection and promotion of humanrights extend the International Bill of Human Rights. Forexample, African states have created their own Charter ofHuman and Peoples Rights (1981), and Muslim stateshave created the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam(1990). The dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, Africa,and Latin America since 1989 have powerfully demonstrateda surge in demand for respect of human rights. Popular movementsin China, Korea, and other Asian nations reveal a similarcommitment to these principles.The Role of NongovernmentalOrganizationsGlobally the champions of human rightshave most often been citizens, not government officials.In particular,nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) haveplayed a cardinal role in focusing the international communityon human rights issues. For example, NGO activities surroundingthe 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Womenin Beijing, China, drew unprecedented attention to seriousviolations of the human rights of women. NGOs such as AmnestyInternational, the Antislavery Society, the InternationalCommission of Jurists, the International Working Group onIndigenous Affairs, Human Rights Watch, Minnesota Advocatesfor Human Rights, and Survivors International monitor theactions of governments and pressure them to act accordingto human rights principles.Government officials who understandthe human rights framework can also effect far reachingchange for freedom. Many United States Presidents such asAbraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson,and Jimmy Carter have taken strong stands for human rights.In other countries leaders like Nelson Mandela and VaclevHavel have brought about great changes under the bannerof human rights.Human rights is an idea whose time hascome. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a callto freedom and justice for people throughout the world.Every day governments that violate the rights of their citizensare challenged and called to task. Every day human beingsworldwide mobilize and confront injustice and inhumanity.Like drops of water falling on a rock, they wear down theforces of oppression and move the world closer to achievingthe principles expressed in the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights.Source: Adapted from David Shiman, TeachingHuman Rights, (Denver: Center for Teaching InternationalRelations Publications, U of Denver, 1993): 6-7.', 'url': 'http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/Part-1/short-history.htm', 'cleaned_text': 'A Short History of Human Rights\nThe belief that everyone, by virtue of her or his humanity, is entitled to certain human rights is fairly new. Its roots, however, lie in earlier tradition and documents of many cultures; it took the catalyst of World War II to propel human rights onto the global stage and into the global conscience.\n\nThroughout much of history, people acquired rights and responsibilities through their membership in a group - a family, indigenous nation, religion, class, community, or state. Most societies have had traditions similar to the ""golden rule"" of ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" The Hindu Vedas, the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the Bible, the Quran (Koran), and the Analects of Confucius are five of the oldest written sources which address questions of people\'s duties, rights, and responsibilities. In addition, the Inca and Aztec codes of conduct and justice and an Iroquois Constitution were Native American sources that existed well before the 18th century. In fact, all societies, whether in oral or written tradition, have had systems of propriety and justice as well as ways of tending to the health and welfare of their members.\n\nPrecursors of 20th Century Human Rights Documents\nDocuments asserting individual rights, such the Magna Carta (1215), the English Bill of Rights (1689), the French Declaration on the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789), and the US Constitution and Bill of Rights (1791) are the written precursors to many of today\'s human rights documents. Yet many of these documents, when originally translated into policy, excluded women, people of color, and members of certain social, religious, economic, and political groups. Nevertheless, oppressed people throughout the world have drawn on the principles these documents express to support revolutions that assert the right to self-determination.\n\nContemporary international human rights law and the establishment of the United Nations (UN) have important historical antecedents. Efforts in the 19th century to prohibit the slave trade and to limit the horrors of war are prime examples. In 1919, countries established the International Labor Organization (ILO) to oversee treaties protecting workers with respect to their rights, including their health and safety. Concern over the protection of certain minority groups was raised by the League of Nations at the end of the First World War. However, this organization for international peace and cooperation, created by the victorious European allies, never achieved its goals. The League floundered because the United States refused to join and because the League failed to prevent Japan\'s invasion of China and Manchuria (1931) and Italy\'s attack on Ethiopia (1935). It finally died with the onset of the Second World War (1939).\n\nThe Birth of the United Nations\nThe idea of human rights emerged stronger after World War II. The extermination by Nazi Germany of over six million Jews, Sinti and Romani (gypsies), homosexuals, and persons with disabilities horrified the world. Trials were held in Nuremberg and Tokyo after World War II, and officials from the defeated countries were punished for committing war crimes, ""crimes against peace,"" and ""crimes against humanity.""\n\nGovernments then committed themselves to establishing the United Nations, with the primary goal of bolstering international peace and preventing conflict. People wanted to ensure that never again would anyone be unjustly denied life, freedom, food, shelter, and nationality. The essence of these emerging human rights principles was captured in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\'s 1941 State of the Union Address when he spoke of a world founded on four essential freedoms: freedom of speech and religion and freedom from want and fear.

The European wars of religion and the civil wars of seventeenth-century Kingdom of England gave rise to the philosophy of liberalism and belief in natural rights became a central concern of European intellectual culture during the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment. Ideas of natural rights, which had a basis in natural law, lay at the core of the American and French Revolutions which occurred toward the end of that century, but the idea of human rights came about later. Democratic evolution through the nineteenth century paved the way for the advent of universal suffrage in the twentieth century. Two world wars led to the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The post-war era saw movements arising from specific groups experiencing a shortfall in their rights, such as feminism and the civil rights of African Americans. The human rights movements of members of the Soviet bloc emerged in the 1970s along with workers\' rights movements in the West. The movements quickly jelled as social activism and political rhetoric in many nations put human rights high on the world agenda.[1] By the 21st century, historian Samuel Moyn has argued, the human rights movement expanded beyond its original anti-totalitarianism to include numerous causes involving humanitarianism and social and economic development in the Developing World.[2]The history of human rights has been complex. Many established rights for instance would be replaced by other systems which deviate from their original western design. Stable institutions may be uprooted such as in cases of conflict such as war and terrorism or a change in culture.[3]Ancient and pre-modern eras[edit]Some notions of righteousness present in ancient law and religion are sometimes retrospectively included under the term ""human rights"". While Enlightenment philosophers suggest a secular social contract between the rulers and the ruled, ancient traditions derived similar conclusions from notions of divine law, and, in Hellenistic philosophy, natural law. Samuel Moyn suggests that the concept of human rights is intertwined with the modern sense of citizenship, which did not emerge until the past few hundred years.[4] Nonetheless, relevant examples exist in the Ancient and pre-modern eras, although Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights.[5]Ancient West Asia[edit]The reforms of Urukagina of Lagash, the earliest known legal code (c. 2350 BC), is often thought to be an early example of reform. Professor Norman Yoffee wrote that after Igor M. Diakonoff ""most interpreters consider that Urukagina, himself not of the ruling dynasty at Lagash, was no reformer at all. Indeed, by attempting to curb the encroachment of a secular authority at the expense of temple prerogatives, he was, if a modern term must be applied, a reactionary.""[6] Author Marilyn French wrote that the discovery of penalties for adultery for women but not for men represents ""the first written evidence of the degradation of women"".[6][7] The oldest legal code extant today is the Neo-Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2050 BC). Several other sets of laws were also issued in Mesopotamia, including the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1780 BC), one of the most famous examples of this type of document. It shows rules, and punishments if those rules are broken, on a variety of matters, including women\'s rights, men\'s rights, children\'s rights and slave rights.Africa[edit]The Northeast African civilization of Ancient Egypt[8] supported basic human rights.[9] For example, Pharaoh Bocchoris (725–720 BC) promoted individual rights, suppressed imprisonment for debt, and reformed laws relating to the transferral of property.[9]Antiquity[edit]Many historians suggest that the Achaemenid Persian Empire of ancient Iran established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under Cyrus the Great. After his conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, the king issued the Cyrus cylinder, discovered in 1879 and seen by some today as the first human rights document.[10][11][12] The cylinder has been linked by some commentators to the decrees of Cyrus recorded in the Books of Chronicles, Nehemiah, and Ezra, which state that Cyrus allowed (at least some of) the Jews to return to their homeland from their Babylonian Captivity. Additionally it stated the freedom to practice one\'s faith without persecution and forced conversions.[13][14] According to art historian Neil MacGregor, the proclamation of full religious freedoms in Babylon and elsewhere in the Persian empire was an important inspiration for human rights by prominent thinkers millennia later, especially in the United States.[15]In opposition to the above viewpoint, the interpretation of the Cylinder as a ""charter of human rights"" has been dismissed by other historians and characterized by some others as political propaganda devised by the Pahlavi regime.[16] The German historian Josef Wiesehöfer argues that the image of ""Cyrus as a champion of the UN human rights policy ... is just as much a phantom as the humane and enlightened Shah of Persia"",[17] while historian Elton L. Daniel has described such an interpretation as ""rather anachronistic"" and tendentious.[18] The cylinder now lies in the British Museum, and a replica is kept at the United Nations Headquarters.Many thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early poleis of ancient Greece, where all free citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.[19]The Twelve Tables Law established the principle ""Privilegia ne irroganto"", which literally means ""privileges shall not be imposed"".The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, who ruled from 268 to 232 BCE, established the largest empire in South Asia. Following the reportedly destructive Kalinga War, Ashoka adopted Buddhism and abandoned an expansionist policy in favor of humanitarian reforms. The Edicts of Ashoka were erected throughout his empire, containing the \'Law of Piety\'.[20] These laws prohibited religious discrimination, and cruelty against both humans and animals.[21] The Edicts emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of prisoners of war was also condemned by Ashoka.[22] Some sources claim that slavery was also non-existent in ancient India.[23] The Greek records say there is absence of slavery during the rule of Sandrocottus.[24]In ancient Rome an ius gentium or jus gentium was a right which a citizen was due simply by dint of his citizenship.[25] The concept of a Roman ius is a precursor to a right as conceived in the Western European tradition. The word ""justice"" is derived from ius. Human rights legislation in the Roman Empire included the introduction of the presumption of innocence by Emperor Antoninus Pius[26] and the Edict of Milan by Emperor Constantine the Great establishing complete freedom of religion.[27]The coining of the phrase \'Human rights\' can be attributed to Tertullian in his letter To Scapula wherein he wrote about the religious freedom in Roman Empire.[28][29] He equated ""fundamental human rights"" as a ""privilege of nature"" in this letter.Early Islamic caliphate[edit]Historians generally agree that Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day,[30] and that Islamic social reforms in areas such as social security, family structure, slavery, and the rights of women and ethnic minorities were intended to improve on what was present in existing Arab society at the time.[31][32][33][34][35][36] For example, according to Bernard Lewis, Islam ""from the first denounced aristocratic privilege, rejected hierarchy, and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents.""[which?][31] John Esposito sees Muhammad as a reformer who condemned practices of the pagan Arabs such as female infanticide, exploitation of the poor, usury, murder, false contracts, and theft.[37] Bernard Lewis believes that the egalitarian nature of Islam ""represented a very considerable advance on the practice of both the Greco-Roman and the ancient Persian world.""[31] Muhammed also incorporated Arabic and Mosaic laws and customs of the time into his divine revelations.[38]The Constitution of Medina, also known as the Charter of Medina, was drafted by Muhammad in 622. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as Medina), including Muslims, Jews, and pagans.[39][40] The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws (Aus) and Khazraj within Medina. To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community-the Ummah.[41]If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.[42] Lewis states that Islam brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching consequences. ""One of these was the presumption of freedom; the other, the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined circumstances,"" Lewis continues. The position of the Arabian slave was ""enormously improved"": the Arabian slave ""was now no longer merely a chattel but was also a human being with a certain religious and hence a social status and with certain quasi-legal rights.""[43]Esposito states that reforms in women\'s rights affected marriage, divorce and inheritance.[37] Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.[44] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women\'s full personhood.[45] ""The dowry, previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property.""[37][46] Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a ""status"" but rather as a ""contract"", in which the woman\'s consent was imperative.[37][45][46] ""Women were given inheritance rights in a patriarchal society that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives.""[37] Annemarie Schimmel states that ""compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work.""[47] William Montgomery Watt states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women\'s rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: ""At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible—they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons."" Muhammad, however, by ""instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards.""[48] Haddad and Esposito state that ""Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of family life, marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women\'s status in society.""[49] However, other writers have argued that women before Islam were more liberated drawing most often on the first marriage of Muhammad and that of Muhammad\'s parents, but also on other points such as worship of female idols at Mecca.[50]Sociologist Robert Bellah (Beyond belief) argues that Islam in its 7th-century origins was, for its time and place, ""remarkably modern...in the high degree of commitment, involvement, and participation expected from the rank-and-file members of the community."" This is because, he argues, that Islam emphasized the equality of all Muslims, where leadership positions were open to all. Dale Eickelman writes that Bellah suggests ""the early Islamic community placed a particular value on individuals, as opposed to collective or group responsibility.""[51]Early Islamic law\'s principles concerning military conduct and the treatment of prisoners of war under the early Caliphate are considered precursors to international humanitarian law. The many requirements on how prisoners of war should be treated included, for example, providing shelter, food and clothing, respecting their cultures, and preventing any acts of execution, rape or revenge. Some of these principles were not codified in Western international law until modern times.[52] Islamic law under the early Caliphate institutionalised humanitarian limitations on military conduct, including attempts to limit the severity of war, guidelines for ceasing hostilities, distinguishing between civilians and combatants, preventing unnecessary destruction, and caring for the sick and wounded.[53]Middle Ages[edit]The concept of human rights in the medieval ages built on the natural law tradition. This tradition was heavily influenced by the writings of St Paul\'s early Christian thinkers such as St Hilary of Poitiers, St Ambrose, and St Augustine.[54] Augustine was among the earliest to examine the legitimacy of the laws of man, and attempt to define the boundaries of what laws and rights occur naturally based on wisdom and conscience, instead of being arbitrarily imposed by mortals, and if people are obligated to obey laws that are unjust.[55]This medieval tradition became prominent and influenced the Magna Carta is an English charter originally issued in 1215 which influenced the development of the common law and many later constitutional documents related to human rights, such as the 1689 English Bill of Rights, the 1789 United States Constitution, and the 1791 United States Bill of Rights.[56]Magna Carta was originally written because of disagreements between Pope Innocent III, King John and the English barons about the rights of the King. Magna Carta required the King to renounce certain rights, respect certain legal procedures and accept that his will could be bound by the law. It explicitly protected certain rights of the King\'s subjects, whether free or fettered—most notably the writ of habeas corpus, allowing appeal against unlawful imprisonment.For modern times, the most enduring legacy of Magna Carta is considered the right of habeas corpus. This right arises from what are now known as clauses 36, 38, 39, and 40 of the 1215 Magna Carta. Magna Carta also included the right to due process:No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.— Clause XXIX of Magna CartaThe statute of Kalisz (1264), bestowed privileges to the Jewish minority in the Kingdom of Poland such as protection from discrimination and hate speech.[57]At the Council of Constance (1414–1418), scholar and jurist Pawel Wlodkowic delivered an address from his Tractatus de potestate papae et imperatoris respectu infidelium (""Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor Respecting Infidels"") in which he advocated the peaceful coexistence of Christians and pagans, making him a precursor of religious tolerance in Europe.[58]Early modern period and modern foundations[edit]Age of Discovery, early modern period and Age of Enlightenment[edit]The conquest of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries by Spain, during the Age of Discovery, resulted in vigorous debate about human rights in Colonial Spanish America.[59] This led to the issuance of the Laws of Burgos by Ferdinand the Catholic on behalf of his daughter, Joanna of Castile. Friar Antonio de Montesinos, a Friar of the Dominican Order at the Island of Hispaniola, delivered a sermon on December 21, 1511, which was attended by Bartolomé de las Casas. It is believed that reports from the Dominicans in Hispaniola motivated the Spanish Crown to act. The sermon, known as the Christmas Sermon, gave way to further debates from 1550–51 between Las Casas and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda at Valladolid. Among the provisions of the Laws of Burgos were child labor; women\'s rights; wages; suitable accommodations; and rest/vacation, among others.Several 17th- and 18th-century European philosophers, most notably John Locke, developed the concept of natural rights, the notion that people are naturally free and equal.[60] Locke believed natural rights were derived from divinity since humans were creations of God, and his ideas were important in the development of the modern notion of rights. Lockean natural rights did not rely on citizenship nor any law of the state, nor were they necessarily limited to one particular ethnic, cultural or religious group. Around the same time, in 1689, the English Bill of Rights was created which asserted some basic human rights,[61] most famously freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.[62]In the 1700s, the novel became a popular form of entertainment. Popular novels, such as Julie, or the New Heloise by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded by Samuel Richardson, laid a foundation for popular acceptance of human rights by making readers empathize with characters unlike themselves.[63][64]Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century in the United States (1776) and in France (1789). The Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 sets up a number of fundamental rights and freedoms. The later United States Declaration of Independence includes concepts of natural rights and famously states ""that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness""; this was followed in 1789 by the United States Bill of Rights, that enumerated specific rights, such as freedom of speech and the right against self-incrimination. Similarly, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen defines a set of individual and collective rights of the people. These are, in the document, held to be universal—not only to French citizens but to all men without exception.19th century to World War I[edit]Philosophers such as Thomas Paine, John Stuart Mill and Hegel expanded on the theme of universality during the 18th and 19th centuries.In 1831 William Lloyd Garrison wrote in The Liberator newspaper that he was trying to enlist his readers in ""the great cause of human rights""[65] so the term human rights may have come into use sometime between Paine\'s The Rights of Man and Garrison\'s publication. In 1849, a contemporary, Henry David Thoreau, wrote about human rights in his treatise On the Duty of Civil Disobedience which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers. United States Supreme Court Justice David Davis, in his 1867 opinion for Ex parte Milligan, wrote: ""By the protection of the law, human rights are secured; withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people.""[66]Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In Western Europe and North America, labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing safer work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labor. The women\'s suffrage movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote. National liberation movements in the Global South succeeded in gaining many countries independence from Western colonialism, one of the most influential being Mahatma Gandhi\'s leadership of the Indian independence movement. Movements by ethnic and religious minorities for racial and religious equality succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the American civil rights movement, and more recent diverse identity politics movements, on behalf of women and minorities which have occurred around the world.[citation needed]The foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the 1864 Lieber Code and the first of the Geneva Conventions in 1864 laid the foundations of international humanitarian law, to be further developed following the two World Wars.Auguries of United Nations human rights law have been located in the late-19th century movement to suppress and abolish slavery across the world as well as in the conventional protection of minorities from religious, racial, and national discrimination within states under the auspices of unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral treaty law, first found in the 1878 Treaty of Berlin.[67][68]Pope Leo XIII\'s Apostolic Exhortation Rerum Novarum in 1891 marked the official beginning of Catholic Social Teaching. The document was principally concerned with discussing workers\' rights, property rights, and citizens\' rights against State intrusion. From that time forward, popes (and Vatican II) would release apostolic exhortations and encyclicals on topics that touched on human rights more and more frequently.The proposition that a state\'s agents could be held criminally responsible for atrocities perpetrated against the state\'s own nationals was advanced by the British, French, and Russian governments in May 1915 in response to Turkey\'s genocide of Armenians.[69][70]Between World War I and World War II[edit]The League of Nations was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles following the end of World War I. The League\'s goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its Charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The League of Nations had mandates to support many of the former colonies of the Western European colonial powers during their transition from colony to independent state.Established as an agency of the League of Nations, and now part of United Nations, the International Labour Organization also had a mandate to promote and safeguard certain of the rights later included in the UDHR:the primary goal of the ILO today is to promote opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work, in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.— Report by the Director General for the International Labour Conference 87th SessionAlso of particular note is the ILO\'s 1919 convention protecting women from pregnancy discrimination in employment, the 1921 Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, and the 1930 Forced Labour Convention.Modern human rights movement[edit]After World War II[edit]Rights in war and the extension of the Geneva Conventions[edit]The Geneva Conventions came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The conventions safeguard the human rights of individuals involved in conflict, and follow on from the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, the international community\'s first attempt to define laws of war. Despite first being framed before World War II, the conventions were revised as a result of World War II and readopted by the international community in 1949.The Geneva Conventions are:- The Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field was adopted in 1864. It was significantly revised and replaced by the 1906 version,[71] the 1929 version, and later the First Geneva Convention of 1949.[72]- The Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea was adopted in 1906.[73] It was significantly revised and replaced by the Second Geneva Convention of 1949.- The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War was adopted in 1929. It was significantly revised and replaced by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949.- The Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War was adopted in 1949.In addition, there are three additional amendment protocols to the Geneva Convention:- Protocol I (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts.- Protocol II (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts.- Protocol III (2005): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem.All four conventions were last revised and ratified in 1949, based on previous revisions and partly on some of the 1907 Hague Conventions. Later, conferences have added provisions prohibiting certain methods of warfare and addressing issues of civil wars. Nearly all 200 countries of the world are ""signatory"" nations, in that they have ratified these conventions. The International Committee of the Red Cross is the controlling body of the Geneva conventions.Universal Declaration of Human Rights[edit]The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a non-binding declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly[75] in 1948, partly in response to the barbarism of World War II. The Declaration urges member nations to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights are part of the ""foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world"". It was declared by the United Nations General Assembly to be a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations. It sets forth, for the first time in history, fundamental human rights to be universally protected.[76]...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world— Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with Eleanor Roosevelt as Chair, who began to discuss an ""International Bill of Rights"" in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority.[77] Canadian law professor John Humphrey and French lawyer Rene Cassin were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. The final three articles place, according to Cassin, rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized.[77] Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:[77]Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.— Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948Some of the Declaration was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi.[78] The inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights[77][79] was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. Though this principle was not opposed by any member states at the time of adoption (the declaration was adopted unanimously, with the abstention of the Soviet Bloc, Apartheid South Africa and Saudi Arabia), this principle was later subject to significant challenges.[79]European Convention on Human Rights[edit]The UN declaration was succeeded by the European Convention on Human Rights, a binding convention drafted by the Council of Europe in 1950 and signed by 47 countries.[80] The Convention has 18 articles, 13 of which are rights guaranteed under it:[81]- Right to life – All human beings have a right to live without being subjected to unlawful killing, the exception being lawful self-defence or defence of another. Under this article all states have a responsibility to investigate suspicious deaths and take positive action to prevent loss of life in certain circumstances.- Prohibition of torture – Without exception, nobody can be subjected to torture or ""cruel and degrading treatment"".- Prohibition of slavery – Slavery, servitude and forced labour are forbidden unless part of legal penal servitude, compulsory military service or required to be done during a state of emergency.- Right to liberty and security – All people have a right to liberty except in the context of judicial imprisonment. The article also provides those arrested with the right to be informed, in a language they understand, of the reasons for the arrest and any charge they face, the right of prompt access to judicial proceedings to determine the legality of the arrest or detention, to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, and the right to compensation in the case of arrest or detention in violation of this article.- Right to a fair trial – Anybody accused of a crime has the right to a public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal within reasonable time, the presumption of innocence, and other minimum rights for those charged with a criminal offence (adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence, access to legal representation, right to examine witnesses against them or have them examined, right to the free assistance of an interpreter)- Freedom from retroactive punishment – Nobody can be prosecuted for an act or omission that was not illegal under national or international law at the time.- Right to privacy – Under the ECHR, all people have a right to respect for one\'s ""private and family life, his home and his correspondence"" as long as none of it violates the law. Among other things, this article forbids illegal police searches and legally protects private sexual activity.- Freedom of thought, conscience and religion – All people have a right to freely express their beliefs as long as those beliefs are not illegal, to change their religion, and to express religious belief through worship, teaching, practice and observance.- Freedom of assembly – All people have a right to form or join any group or organization for any purpose as long as that purpose is not illegal.- Right to marriage – All men and women of marriageable age have a right to marry and form a family. Controversially this protection only applies to heterosexual couples.- Freedom of expression – All people may freely express their opinions and impart and receive information except in certain extreme circumstances.- Freedom from discrimination – Protects rights defined elsewhere in the convention from being denied on the basis of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status. 20 of the 47 signatories adhere to an additional protocol extending this to cover discrimination in any legal right.- Right to remedy – Anybody who believes their rights have been violated may petition the European Court of Human Rights to have their case heard and their grievances addressed and redressed.The other five articles address enforcement of the rights enumerated in the convention and special circumstances in which these rights can be restricted. The United Kingdom, one of the signatories of the ECHR, later passed the Human Rights Act 1998 enshrining these rights in UK law and giving the judiciary the ability to enforce them under UK law.Late 20th century[edit]We have already found a high degree of personal liberty, and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity. Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our natural beauty preserved; the powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.Jimmy Carter Inaugural Address.[82]According to historian Samuel Moyn the next major landmark in human rights happened in the 1970s.[83] Human rights were included in point VII of the Helsinki Accords, which was signed in 1975 by thirty-five states, including the United States, Canada, and all European states except Albania and Andorra.During his inaugural speech in 1977, the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter made human rights a pillar of United States foreign policy.[84] Human rights advocacy organization Amnesty International later won the Nobel Peace Prize also in 1977.[85] Carter, who was instrumental to the Camp David accord peace treaty would himself win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 ""for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development"".[86]21st century[edit]Human rights advocacy has continued into the early 21st century, centred around achieving greater economic and political freedom.[87] In July 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it is recognized that everyone on the planet has a right to a healthy environment. It called on states to step up efforts to ensure their people have access to a ""clean, healthy and sustainable environment.""[88]See also[edit]Notes[edit]- ^ Samuel Moyn, The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History (Harvard University Press, 2010)- ^ Scott McLemee, ""The Last Utopia"" Inside Higher Education Dec. 8, 2010 online Archived 2020-10-04 at the Wayback Machine- ^ Human Rights: Commitment and Betrayal, M.G.

The European wars of religion and the civil wars of seventeenth-century Kingdom of England gave rise to the philosophy of liberalism and belief in natural rights became a central concern of European intellectual culture during the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment. Ideas of natural rights, which had a basis in natural law, lay at the core of the American and French Revolutions which occurred toward the end of that century, but the idea of human rights came about later. Democratic evolution through the nineteenth century paved the way for the advent of universal suffrage in the twentieth century. Two world wars led to the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe post-war era saw movements arising from specific groups experiencing a shortfall in their rights, such as feminism and the civil rights of African Americans. The human rights movements of members of the Soviet bloc emerged in the 1970s along with workers\' rights movements in the West. The movements quickly jelled as social activism and political rhetoric in many nations put human rights high on the world agenda. By the 21st century, historian Samuel Moyn has argued, the human rights movement expanded beyond its original anti-totalitarianism to include numerous causes involving humanitarianism and social and economic development in the Developing World.\n\nThe history of human rights has been complex. Many established rights for instance would be replaced by other systems which deviate from their original western design. Stable institutions may be uprooted such as in cases of conflict such as war and terrorism or a change in culture.\n\nAncient and pre-modern eras\nSome notions of righteousness present in ancient law and religion are sometimes retrospectively included under the term ""human rights"". While Enlightenment philosophers suggest a secular social contract between the rulers and the ruled, ancient traditions derived similar conclusions from notions of divine law, and, in Hellenistic philosophy, natural law. Samuel Moyn suggests that the concept of human rights is intertwined with the modern sense of citizenship, which did not emerge until the past few hundred years. Nonetheless, relevant examples exist in the Ancient and pre-modern eras, although Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights.\n\nAncient West Asia\nThe reforms of Urukagina of Lagash, the earliest known legal code (c. 2350 BC), is often thought to be an early example of reform. Professor Norman Yoffee wrote that after Igor M. Diakonoff ""most interpreters consider that Urukagina, himself not of the ruling dynasty at Lagash, was no reformer at all. Indeed, by attempting to curb the encroachment of a secular authority at the expense of temple prerogatives, he was, if a modern term must be applied, a reactionary."" Author Marilyn French wrote that the discovery of penalties for adultery for women but not for men represents ""the first written evidence of the degradation of women"". The oldest legal code extant today is the Neo-Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2050 BC). Several other sets of laws were also issued in Mesopotamia, including the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1780 BC), one of the most famous examples of this type of document. It shows rules, and punishments if those rules are broken, on a variety of matters, including women\'s rights, men\'s rights, children\'s rights and slave rights.\n\nAfrica\nThe Northeast African civilization of Ancient Egypt supported basic human rights. For example, Pharaoh Bocchoris (725–720 BC) promoted individual rights, suppressed imprisonment for debt, and reformed laws relating to the transferral of property.\n\nAntiquity\nMany historians suggest that the Achaemenid Persian Empire of ancient Iran established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under Cyrus the Great. After his conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, the king issued the Cyrus cylinder, discovered in 1879 and seen by some today as the first human rights document. The cylinder has been linked by some commentators to the decrees of Cyrus recorded in the Books of Chronicles, Nehemiah, and Ezra, which state that Cyrus allowed (at least some of) the Jews to return to their homeland from their Babylonian Captivity. Additionally it stated the freedom to practice one\'s faith without persecution and forced conversions. According to art historian Neil MacGregor, the proclamation of full religious freedoms in Babylon and elsewhere in the Persian empire was an important inspiration for human rights by prominent thinkers millennia later, especially in the United States.\n\nIn opposition to the above viewpoint, the interpretation of the Cylinder as a ""charter of human rights"" has been dismissed by other historians and characterized by some others as political propaganda devised by the Pahlavi regime. The German historian Josef Wiesehöfer argues that the image of ""Cyrus as a champion of the UN human rights policy ... is just as much a phantom as the humane and enlightened Shah of Persia"", while historian Elton L. Daniel has described such an interpretation as ""rather anachronistic"" and tendentious. The cylinder now lies in the British Museum, and a replica is kept at the United Nations Headquarters.\n\nMany thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early poleis of ancient Greece, where all free citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.\nThe Twelve Tables Law established the principle ""Privilegia ne irroganto"", which literally means ""privileges shall not be imposed"".\nThe Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, who ruled from 268 to 232 BCE, established the largest empire in South Asia. Following the reportedly destructive Kalinga War, Ashoka adopted Buddhism and abandoned an expansionist policy in favor of humanitarian reforms. The Edicts of Ashoka were erected throughout his empire, containing the \'Law of Piety\'. These laws prohibited religious discrimination, and cruelty against both humans and animals. The Edicts emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of prisoners of war was also condemned by Ashoka. Some sources claim that slavery was also non-existent in ancient India. The Greek records say there is absence of slavery during the rule of Sandrocottus.\n\nIn ancient Rome an ius gentium or jus gentium was a right which a citizen was due simply by dint of his citizenship. The concept of a Roman ius is a precursor to a right as conceived in the Western European tradition. The word ""justice"" is derived from ius. Human rights legislation in the Roman Empire included the introduction of the presumption of innocence by Emperor Antoninus Pius and the Edict of Milan by Emperor Constantine the Great establishing complete freedom of religion.\n\nThe coining of the phrase \'Human rights\' can be attributed to Tertullian in his letter To Scapula wherein he wrote about the religious freedom in Roman Empire. He equated ""fundamental human rights"" as a ""privilege of nature"" in this letter.\n\nEarly Islamic caliphate\nHistorians generally agree that Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day, and that Islamic social reforms in areas such as social security, family structure, slavery, and the rights of women and ethnic minorities were intended to improve on what was present in existing Arab society at the time. For example, according to Bernard Lewis, Islam ""from the first denounced aristocratic privilege, rejected hierarchy, and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents.""

From the earliest times, for example byb King Hammurabi of Babylon around 1750 BC, laws have been written (or cut in stone) that include principles of justice, fairness and protection. Such laws prescribed that:● people must be protected by law;● a ruler is restricted by law and cannot arbitrarily deal with his subjects;● women, children, foreigners and other groups deserve special protection;● even slaves should not be mistreated;● courts must be free from corruption and arbitrariness.These ancient laws however cannot be equated to ‘human rights’. They were not universal: they were valid for a certain state or society, not for humanity as a whole. They maintained gross inequality: there was no question that a monarch, a citizen and a slave would have the same rights. And much of what we now label human rights is not mentioned in those old laws, such as the right to freedom of opinion or the prohibition of torture.A timelineIn the history of human rights, there is no linear sequence of developments. Yet a series of phases can be distinguished. ‘Phase’ here means that certain ideas and practices had a breakthrough or blossoming in a particular historical time. Not that they were always completely new at the time – see for example the reemergence of people’s representation in Medieval times.- Ancient history: The inherent dignity of human beings. Ideas about the inherent dignity of man originated thousands of years ago, in law and religion. It came with notions such as that one should not use arbitrary violence, lie, steal or break contracts. Already before 200 BC. most of the world’s major belief systems had been founded: the Jewish faith (later developed into Christianity), Confucianism and Daoism in China, Hinduism and Buddhism in India, and the humanistic philosophy of Athens.- 3th century BC: Equality. The idea that equality of rights applies to all people is found in the Greek philosophy of the Stoics. They considered man and woman to be equal. They argued for respect for women and children, for compassion and tolerance towards the other, for inclusion of ‘barbarians’ into the human community. Some stoics considered slaves on equal footing as well.- 13th century: People’s representation. The practice that government owes a responsibility to representatives of the people already existed in Greek city states such as Athens, but thereafter disappeared for many centuries. From the 12th century, small parliaments were established in Scotland, Poland, the kingdom of León and Paris. Most conspicuous was the English Magna Carta of 1215, a contract between the monarch and the (well-to-do) citizens who formed a ‘parlamentium’ (‘talkhouse’).- 18th century: The right to individual freedom. Some protagonists are identified in the next paragraph. This was the era in which the American Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French Declaration of Human Rights and Citizen (1789) were adopted.- 19th century: Socio-economic rights and abolition of slavery. Rights to protection in the field of work and unemployment arose in the 19th century under pressure from the trade union movement. A British national trade union was founded in 1830. Under pressure from within and outside of parliament, the British Empire abolished the slave trade in 1807 and slavery in 1833. Only decades later was slavery abolished in countries such as Russia (1861), the Netherlands (1863) and the United States (1865).- Early 20th century: Equal rights for women and men. Women’s suffrage was introduced in New Zealand (1893), later in countries including The Netherlands and Russia (1917), the United States (1920) and the United Kingdom (1928).- Since 1948: Universal standards. From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) has emerged an ongoing series of international human rights conventions, declarations and monitoring institutions.Five protagonists of individual freedomMany philosophers, activists, politicians and others have contributed to the development of human rights. Major breakthroughs occurred in the 18th century, during the Enlightenment. These are five individuals whose acts and writings had great influence also far beyond the borders of their native countries.- Voltaire (France, 1694-1778) advocated the right to choose a religion or not. From 1726 he lived alternately in exile and under a false name in France. Only at the end of his life he received great honors in France. His writings shaped the ideas of the Enlightenment, his actions on behalf of victims of religious persecution made him an example of free-minded campaigning against injustice and intolerance. The statement attributed to him, ‘I detest your ideas but am willing to die for your right to propagate them’, is actually from a biographer but accurately reflects his life and work.- John Locke (England, 1632-1704) got many of his ideas on rights and politics during his years of exile in the Netherlands (1683-1688). In his Two Treatises of Government (1690), he assumed a ‘natural state’ in which all people are born free and equal, and not subject to any authority. Civil society replaces that natural state. The state so becomes the result of a social contract, in which people voluntarily commit themselves to the decisions of the majority. In that society, the king has no divine right and everyone has inalienable rights to life, freedom, property and health.- Cesare Beccaria (Italy, 1735-1794) published On crime and punishment in 1764. The legal system must contribute to the greatest happiness of the greatest number, it should never be dependent on the arbitrary power of kings and nobility. Punishments must be humane, capital punishment and torture must be abolished. His logically constructed system makes Beccaria a founder of the rule of law.- Thomas Paine (1737-1809) was born in England and emigrated to America in 1774. There he published Common Sense, a call for American independence that sold a hundred thousand copies within a year. He witnessed the revolution in France, escaped the guillotine and on return to England published The Rights of Man (1791). Its principles are first, that all people are born free and have equal rights. Second, that politics must not interfere with ‘natural’ rights of people such as freedom, property, security and the right to resist oppression. And third, that state power comes from the people.- Mary Wollstonecraft (England, 1759-1797), who was friends with Paine, wrote the first book on how women should be fully equal to men: in their rights, their opportunities of education, their representation in politics. In her Vindication of the Rights of Women (1791), she says: ‘Women, I acknowledge, have other duties to fulfill; but the principles to which they must be subject, so I will stubbornly maintain, must be the same.’ And: ‘I really think women should be represented [in politics]’. After her premature death, the public showed more interest in her love life than in her writings. It took another hundred years for her ideas to be widely taken seriously.ProcessesWhat processes have driven the historical development of human rights? One factor behind the development of human rights is the pursuit of freedom in the sense of emancipation for such groups as citizens, workers, women and slaves. There is also the pursuit of legalization, as in international laws against atrocities such as slavery, torture and imprisonment. In human rights the principle of objectivity is crucial, in that reporting should be factual and honest. The Roman historian Tacitus (1st century) already wrote that historical descriptions should be ‘sine ira et studio’ (without resentment or bias). Humaneness is a driving force behind the efforts to limit both physical and mental cruelty. Sentimentality appeals to compassion for others as human beings who have feelings just like you: slaves, the poor, the insane, criminals, women and children. Around 1750 a fiction literature arose in Europe in which empathy plays an important role for the less fortunate. In his Nobel Prize speech, Barack Obama summarized the process as ‘the continuous expansion of moral imagination’. The idea of universality emphasizes the validity of humanity, norms and moral judgments wherever and whenever. We find it already in Greek Stoa philosophy. Finally, there is the appeal to activism. Karl Marx wrote in 1845: ‘Philosophers have only interpreted the world. The point is to change it.’ In human rights, the path to that change is non-partisan and non-violent.The Universal Declaration of Human RightsOnly in 1948 did a true worldwide statement come to pass: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In essence, the text is the elaboration of an idea that has existed since time immemorial: that shared fundamental rights are needed because society cannot exist without them. A society that allows arbitrariness in the form of deception, or breach of contract, or random violence, or indiscriminate killings is a danger to itself.The principles of the UDHR came from studying many sources of law of Western history, but references to a belief or tradition were left out in the final text. People with very different professional backgrounds and with different beliefs and ideologies were involved in the shaping of the declaration. That the final text includes a wide range of human rights including socio-economic rights, is due in particular to the different backgrounds of Western participants in de preparatory debates. When it came into existence, not all countries agreed with the UDHR (that is, eight countries abstained from the final vote). Yet decisions not to amend the Universal Declaration were taken by the UN member states in 1968 (Tehran) and 1993 (Vienna) without a vote against. That means that all UN member states, and not only those who agreed in 1948, have now accepted the UDHR (as does Taiwan, kicked out of the UN in 1971). Since 1948, the United Nations have adopted some 300 treaties and declarations in the field of human rights. References to the Universal Declaration are found in the constitutions of at least ninety countries.Aren’t human rights actually of a recent date?In his book The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History (2010), American historian Samuel Moyn argues that only around 1968 did human rights become a concept that united humanity in its struggle for justice. In Eastern and Western Europe, as well as in the United States and Latin America, human rights crystallized within a few years as the key word in social activism, the rhetoric of international politics and the actions of the United Nations. That was in the space left by the demise of earlier political utopias, such as communism and nationalism. Moyn describes how modern human rights ideology took flight with Amnesty International, the organization that was founded in 1961 and grew into a genuine transnational movement in the 1970s. That organization rendered human rights a broadly shared commitment that is not government dependent. Amnesty was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977. That same year, U.S. President Carter made human rights the cornerstone of his foreign policy.The human rights defenders of Amnesty and other organizations refer to historical sources for their work, in particular the Enlightenment. Moyn does not feel that such reference is valid: ‘During the Enlightenment, people did not light candles to get prisoners free. They rather put the king’s neck under the guillotine.’ So human rights have been with us for only a few decades? In the sense of a concept that is recognized worldwide: yes. But as this article argues, ideas and practices from long ago have shaped what we now call human rights.', 'url': 'https://www.amnesty.nl/a-brief-history-of-human-rights', 'cleaned_text': 'A brief history of human rights\nThe history of human rights is actually a combination of various histories.\n- Human rights in philosophy: the ideas on human dignity and the rights that belong to everyone everywhere.\n- Human rights in law: the norms and sanctions that over the centuries have been laid down in (international) law, treaties and declarations.\n- Human rights in politics and campaigning: the practice of denouncing abuses of governments and calling for solidarity and action for the victims.\n\nAre human rights as old as human civilization?\nSome human rights ideas are as old as civilization.

These early ideas, however, were not inalienable and were often tied to one's status or citizenship.

A key precursor is the Cyrus Cylinder from **539 B.C.** This ancient clay artifact is often recognized as an early charter of human rights. After conquering Babylon, Cyrus the Great issued a decree that freed slaves, declared that all people had the right to choose their own religion, and established racial equality. The United Nations highlights its significance as a historical testament to tolerance and respect for others (**UN**).

These ancient codes established important precedents. As historian Neil MacGregor states, the Cyrus Cylinder represents a ""new kind of statecraft"" focused on managing a ""diversity of peoples."" While not a modern rights document, it laid crucial groundwork for the philosophical evolution of human rights by establishing that a just ruler had duties toward their subjects."

In order to avoid tightly coupling classes, we can use interfaces to provide a level of indirection. Let’s create an interface to represent a weapon in our game.\n\ninterface IWeapon{\nvoid Hit(string target);\n}\nThen, our Sword class can implement this interface:\nclass Sword : IWeapon{\npublic void Hit(string target){\nConsole.WriteLine(""Chopped {0} clean in half"", target);\n}}\nAnd we can alter our Samurai class:\nclass Samurai{\nreadonly IWeapon weapon;\npublic Samurai(){\nthis.weapon = new Sword();\n}\npublic void Attack(string target){\nthis.weapon.Hit(target);\n}}\nNow our Samurai can be armed with different weapons. But wait! The Sword is still created inside the constructor of Samurai. Since we still need to alter the implementation of Samurai in order to give our warrior another weapon, Samurai is still tightly coupled to Sword.\n\nFortunately, there is an easy solution. Rather than creating the Sword from within the constructor of Samurai, we can expose it as a parameter of the constructor instead. Also known as Constructor Injection.\n\nclass Samurai{\nreadonly IWeapon weapon;\npublic Samurai(IWeapon weapon){\nthis.weapon = weapon;\n}\npublic void Attack(string target){\nthis.weapon.Hit(target);\n}}\nAs Giorgio pointed out, there\'s also property injection. That would be something like:\n\nclass Samurai{\nIWeapon weapon;\npublic Samurai() { }\npublic void SetWeapon(IWeapon weapon){\nthis.weapon = weapon;\n}\npublic void Attack(string target){\nthis.weapon.Hit(target);\n}}\nHope this helps.'}, {'raw_text': 'Dependency Injection is a horrible name (IMO) 1 for a rather straightforward concept.

However,What is dependency injection and when/why should or shouldn\'t it be used?There have been several questions already posted with specific questions about dependency injection, such as when to use it and what frameworks are there for it. However,What is dependency injection and when/why should or shouldn\'t it be used?The best definition I\'ve found so far is one by James Shore:""Dependency Injection"" is a 25-dollar term for a 5-cent concept. [...] Dependency injection means giving an object its instance variables. [...].There is an article by Martin Fowler that may prove useful, too.Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself. It\'s a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out.Dependencies can be injected into objects by many means (such as constructor injection or setter injection). One can even use specialized dependency injection frameworks (e.g. Spring) to do that, but they certainly aren\'t required. You don\'t need those frameworks to have dependency injection. Instantiating and passing objects (dependencies) explicitly is just as good an injection as injection by framework.Dependency Injection is passing dependency to other objects or framework( dependency injector).Dependency injection makes testing easier. The injection can be done through constructor.SomeClass() has its constructor as following:public SomeClass() {myObject = Factory.getObject();}Problem:IfmyObject involves complex tasks such as disk access or network access, it is hard to do unit test onSomeClass(). Programmers have to mockmyObject and might intercept the factory call.Alternative solution:myObject in as an argument to the constructorpublic SomeClass (MyClass myObject) {this.myObject = myObject;}myObject can be passed directly which makes testing easier.It is harder to isolate components in unit testing without dependency injection.In 2013, when I wrote this answer, this was a major theme on the Google Testing Blog. It remains the biggest advantage to me, as programmers not always need the extra flexibility in their run-time design (for instance, for service locator or similar patterns). Programmers often need to isolate the classes during testing.I found this funny example in terms of loose coupling:Source: Understanding dependency injectionAny application is composed of many objects that collaborate with each other to perform some useful stuff. Traditionally each object is responsible for obtaining its own references to the dependent objects (dependencies) it collaborate with. This leads to highly coupled classes and hard-to-test code.For example, consider aCar object.ACar depends on wheels, engine, fuel, battery, etc. to run. Traditionally we define the brand of such dependent objects along with the definition of theCar object.Without Dependency Injection (DI):class Car{private Wheel wh = new NepaliRubberWheel();private Battery bt = new ExcideBattery();//The rest}Here, theCar object is responsible for creating the dependent objects.What if we want to change the type of its dependent object - sayWheel - after the initialNepaliRubberWheel() punctures?We need to recreate the Car object with its new dependency sayChineseRubberWheel(), but only theCar manufacturer can do that.Then what does theDependency Injection do for us...?When using dependency injection, objects are given their dependencies at run time rather than compile time (car manufacturing time).So that we can now change theWheel whenever we want. Here, thedependency (wheel) can be injected intoCar at run time.After using dependency injection:Here, we are injecting the dependencies (Wheel and Battery) at runtime. Hence the term : Dependency Injection. We normally rely on DI frameworks such as Spring, Guice, Weld to create the dependencies and inject where needed.class Car{private Wheel wh; // Inject an Instance of Wheel (dependency of car) at runtimeprivate Battery bt; // Inject an Instance of Battery (dependency of car) at runtimeCar(Wheel wh,Battery bt) {this.wh = wh;this.bt = bt;}//Or we can have settersvoid setWheel(Wheel wh) {this.wh = wh;}}The advantages are:new a tire? I don\'t. All I have to do is to buy (inject via param) from them, install and wah-lah! So, coming back to programming, say a C# project needs to use an existing library/class, there are two ways to run/debug, 1-add reference to the entire project of thisnew it, option 2 is pass it in as param. May not be accurate, but simple stupid easy to understand.Dependency Injection is a practice where objects are designed in a manner where they receive instances of the objects from other pieces of code, instead of constructing them internally. This means that any object implementing the interface which is required by the object can be substituted in without changing the code, which simplifies testing, and improves decoupling.For example, consider these clases:public class PersonService {public void addManager( Person employee, Person newManager ) { ... }public void removeManager( Person employee, Person oldManager ) { ... }public Group getGroupByManager( Person manager ) { ... }}public class GroupMembershipService() {public void addPersonToGroup( Person person, Group group ) { ... }public void removePersonFromGroup( Person person, Group group ) { ... }}In this example, the implementation ofPersonService::addManager andPersonService::removeManager would need an instance of theGroupMembershipService in order to do its work. Without Dependency Injection, the traditional way of doing this would be to instantiate a newGroupMembershipService in the constructor ofPersonService and use that instance attribute in both functions. However, if the constructor ofGroupMembershipService has multiple things it requires, or worse yet, there are some initialization ""setters"" that need to be called on theGroupMembershipService, the code grows rather quickly, and thePersonService now depends not only on theGroupMembershipService but also everything else thatGroupMembershipService depends on. Furthermore, the linkage toGroupMembershipService is hardcoded into thePersonService which means that you can\'t ""dummy up"" aGroupMembershipService for testing purposes, or to use a strategy pattern in different parts of your application.With Dependency Injection, instead of instantiating theGroupMembershipService within yourPersonService, you\'d either pass it in to thePersonService constructor, or else add a Property (getter and setter) to set a local instance of it. This means that yourPersonService no longer has to worry about how to create aGroupMembershipService, it just accepts the ones it\'s given, and works with them. This also means that anything which is a subclass ofGroupMembershipService, or implements theGroupMembershipService interface can be ""injected"" into thePersonService, and thePersonService doesn\'t need to know about the change.The accepted answer is a good one - but I would like to add to this that DI is very much like the classic avoiding of hardcoded constants in the code.When you use some constant like a database name you\'d quickly move it from the inside of the code to some config file and pass a variable containing that value to the place where it is needed. The reason to do that is that these constants usually change more frequently than the rest of the code. For example if you\'d like to test the code in a test database.DI is analogous to this in the world of Object Oriented programming. The values there instead of constant literals are whole objects - but the reason to move the code creating them out from the class code is similar - the objects change more frequently then the code that uses them. One important case where such a change is needed is tests.Let\'s try simple example with Car and Engine classes, any car need an engine to go anywhere, at least for now. So below how code will look without dependency injection.public class Car{public Car(){GasEngine engine = new GasEngine();engine.Start();}}public class GasEngine{public void Start(){Console.WriteLine(""I use gas as my fuel!"");}}And to instantiate the Car class we will use next code:Car car = new Car();The issue with this code that we tightly coupled to GasEngine and if we decide to change it to ElectricityEngine then we will need to rewrite Car class. And the bigger the application the more issues and headache we will have to add and use new type of engine.In other words with this approach is that our high level Car class is dependent on the lower level GasEngine class which violate Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP) from SOLID. DIP suggests that we should depend on abstractions, not concrete classes. So to satisfy this we introduce IEngine interface and rewrite code like below:public interface IEngine{void Start();}public class GasEngine : IEngine{public void Start(){Console.WriteLine(""I use gas as my fuel!"");}}public class ElectricityEngine : IEngine{public void Start(){Console.WriteLine(""I am electrocar"");}}public class Car{private readonly IEngine _engine;public Car(IEngine engine){_engine = engine;}public void Run(){_engine.Start();}}Now our Car class is dependent on only the IEngine interface, not a specific implementation of engine. Now, the only trick is how do we create an instance of the Car and give it an actual concrete Engine class like GasEngine or ElectricityEngine. That\'s where Dependency Injection comes in.Car gasCar = new Car(new GasEngine());gasCar.Run();Car electroCar = new Car(new ElectricityEngine());electroCar.Run();Here we basically inject(pass) our dependency(Engine instance) to Car constructor. So now our classes have loose coupling between objects and their dependencies, and we can easily add new types of engines without changing the Car class.The main benefit of the Dependency Injection that classes are more loosely coupled, because they do not have hard-coded dependencies. This follows the Dependency Inversion Principle, which was mentioned above. Instead of referencing specific implementations, classes request abstractions (usually interfaces) which are provided to them when the class is constructed.So in the end Dependency injection is just a technique for achieving loose coupling between objects and their dependencies. Rather than directly instantiating dependencies that class needs in order to perform its actions, dependencies are provided to the class (most often) via constructor injection.Also when we have many dependencies it is very good practice to use Inversion of Control(IoC) containers which we can tell which interfaces should be mapped to which concrete implementations for all our dependencies and we can have it resolve those dependencies for us when it constructs our object. For example, we could specify in the mapping for the IoC container that the IEngine dependency should be mapped to the GasEngine class and when we ask the IoC container for an instance of our Car class, it will automatically construct our Car class with a GasEngine dependency passed in.UPDATE: Watched course about EF Core from Julie Lerman recently and also liked her short definition about DI.Dependency injection is a pattern to allow your application to inject objects on the fly to classes that need them, without forcing those classes to be responsible for those objects. It allows your code to be more loosely coupled, and Entity Framework Core plugs in to this same system of services.Let\'s imagine that you want to go fishing:Without dependency injection, you need to take care of everything yourself. You need to find a boat, to buy a fishing rod, to look for bait, etc. It\'s possible, of course, but it puts a lot of responsibility on you. In software terms, it means that you have to perform a lookup for all these things.With dependency injection, someone else takes care of all the preparation and makes the required equipment available to you. You will receive (""be injected"") the boat, the fishing rod and the bait - all ready to use.This is the most simple explanation about Dependency Injection and Dependency Injection Container I have ever seen:Dependency Injection and dependency Injection Containers are different things:You don\'t need a container to do dependency injection. However a container can help you.Before going to the technical description first visualize it with a real-life example because you will find a lot of technical stuff to learn dependency injection but the majority of the people can\'t get the core concept of it.In the first picture, assume that you have a car factory with a lot of units. A car is actually built in the assembly unit but it needs engine, seats as well as wheels. So an assembly unit is dependent on these all units and they are the dependencies of the factory.You can feel that now it is too complicated to maintain all of the tasks in this factory because along with the main task (assembling a car in the Assembly unit) you have to also focus on other units. It is now very costly to maintain and the factory building is huge so it takes your extra bucks for rent.Now, look at the second picture. If you find some provider companies that will provide you with the wheel, seat, and engine for cheaper than your self-production cost then now you don\'t need to make them in your factory. You can rent a smaller building now just for your assembly unit which will lessen your maintenance task and reduce your extra rental cost. Now you can also focus only on your main task (Car assembly).Now we can say that all the dependencies for assembling a car are injected on the factory from the providers. It is an example of a real-life Dependency Injection (DI).Now in the technical word, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. So, transferring the task of creating the object to someone else and directly using the dependency is called dependency injection.This will help you now to learn DI with a technical explanation. This will show when to use DI and when you should not.Doesn\'t ""dependency injection"" just mean using parameterized constructors and public setters?James Shore\'s article shows the following examples for comparison.Constructor without dependency injection:public class Example { private DatabaseThingie myDatabase; public Example() { myDatabase = new DatabaseThingie(); } public void doStuff() { ... myDatabase.getData(); ... } }Constructor with dependency injection:public class Example { private DatabaseThingie myDatabase; public Example(DatabaseThingie useThisDatabaseInstead) { myDatabase = useThisDatabaseInstead; } public void doStuff() { ... myDatabase.getData(); ... } }new DatabaseThingie() doesn\'t generate a valid myDatabase instance.Nov 22, 2013 at 22:49To make Dependency Injection concept simple to understand. Let\'s take an example of switch button to toggle(on/off) a bulb.Switch needs to know beforehand which bulb I am connected to (hard-coded dependency). So,Switch -> PermanentBulb //switch is directly connected to permanent bulb, testing not possible easilySwitch(){PermanentBulb = new Bulb();PermanentBulb.Toggle();}Switch only knows I need to turn on/off whichever Bulb is passed to me. So,Switch -> Bulb1 OR Bulb2 OR NightBulb (injected dependency)Switch(AnyBulb){ //pass it whichever bulb you likeAnyBulb.Toggle();}Modifying James Example for Switch and Bulb:public class SwitchTest {TestToggleBulb() {MockBulb mockbulb = new MockBulb();// MockBulb is a subclass of Bulb, so we can// ""inject"" it here:Switch switch = new Switch(mockBulb);switch.ToggleBulb();mockBulb.AssertToggleWasCalled();}}public class Switch {private Bulb myBulb;public Switch() {myBulb = new Bulb();}public Switch(Bulb useThisBulbInstead) {myBulb = useThisBulbInstead;}public void ToggleBulb() {...myBulb.Toggle();...}}`What is Dependency Injection (DI)?As others have said, Dependency Injection(DI) removes the responsibility of direct creation, and management of the lifespan, of other object instances upon which our class of interest (consumer class) is dependent (in the UML sense). These instances are instead passed to our consumer class, typically as constructor parameters or via property setters (the management of the dependency object instancing and passing to the consumer class is usually performed by an Inversion of Control (IoC) container, but that\'s another topic).DI, DIP and SOLIDSpecifically, in the paradigm of Robert C Martin\'s SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design,DI is one of the possible implementations of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). The DIP is theD of theSOLID mantra - other DIP implementations include the Service Locator, and Plugin patterns.The objective of the DIP is to decouple tight, concrete dependencies between classes, and instead, to loosen the coupling by means of an abstraction, which can be achieved via aninterface,abstract class orpure virtual class, depending on the language and approach used.Without the DIP, our code (I\'ve called this \'consuming class\') is directly coupled to a concrete dependency and is also often burdened with the responsibility of knowing how to obtain, and manage, an instance of this dependency, i.e. conceptually:""I need to create/use a Foo and invoke method `GetBar()`""Whereas after application of the DIP, the requirement is loosened, and the concern of obtaining and managing the lifespan of theFoo dependency has been removed:""I need to invoke something which offers `GetBar()`""Why use DIP (and DI)?Decoupling dependencies between classes in this way allows for easy substitution of these dependency classes with other implementations which also fulfil the prerequisites of the abstraction (e.g. the dependency can be switched with another implementation of the same interface). Moreover, as others have mentioned, possibly the most common reason to decouple classes via the DIP is to allow a consuming class to be tested in isolation, as these same dependencies can now be stubbed and/or mocked.One consequence of DI is that the lifespan management of dependency object instances is no longer controlled by a consuming class, as the dependency object is now passed into the consuming class (via constructor or setter injection).This can be viewed in different ways:Create on the factory as needed, and dispose of these instances once complete.When to use DI?MyDepClass is thread safe - what if we make it a singleton and inject the same instance into all consumers?)ExampleHere\'s a simple C# implementation. Given the below Consuming class:public class MyLogger{public void LogRecord(string somethingToLog){Console.WriteLine(""{0:HH:mm:ss} - {1}"", DateTime.Now, somethingToLog);}}Although seemingly innocuous, it has twostatic dependencies on two other classes,System.DateTime andSystem.Console, which not only limit the logging output options (logging to console will be worthless if no one is watching), but worse, it is difficult to automatically test given the dependency on a non-deterministic system clock.We can however applyDIP to this class, by abstracting out the the concern of timestamping as a dependency, and couplingMyLogger only to a simple interface:public interface IClock{DateTime Now { get; }}We can also loosen the dependency onConsole to an abstraction, such as aTextWriter. Dependency Injection is typically implemented as eitherconstructor injection (passing an abstraction to a dependency as a parameter to the constructor of a consuming class) orSetter Injection (passing the dependency via asetXyz() setter or a .Net Property with{set;} defined). Constructor Injection is preferred, as this guarantees the class will be in a correct state after construction, and allows the internal dependency fields to be marked asreadonly (C#) orfinal (Java). So using constructor injection on the above example, this leaves us with:public class MyLogger : ILogger // Others will depend on our logger.{private readonly TextWriter _output;private readonly IClock _clock;// Dependencies are injected through the constructorpublic MyLogger(TextWriter stream, IClock clock){_output = stream;_clock = clock;}public void LogRecord(string somethingToLog){// We can now use our dependencies through the abstraction// and without knowledge of the lifespans of the dependencies_output.Write(""{0:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - {1}"", _clock.Now, somethingToLog);}}(A concreteClock needs to be provided, which of course could revert toDateTime.Now, and the two dependencies need to be provided by an IoC container via constructor injection)An automated Unit Test can be built, which definitively proves that our logger is working correctly, as we now have control over the dependencies - the time, and we can spy on the written output:[Test]public void LoggingMustRecordAllInformationAndStampTheTime(){// Arrangevar mockClock = new Mock<IClock>();mockClock.Setup(c => c.Now).Returns(new DateTime(2015, 4, 11, 12, 31, 45));var fakeConsole = new StringWriter();// Actnew MyLogger(fakeConsole, mockClock.Object).LogRecord(""Foo"");// AssertAssert.AreEqual(""2015-04-11 12:31:45 - Foo"", fakeConsole.ToString());}Next StepsDependency injection is invariably associated with an Inversion of Control container(IoC), to inject (provide) the concrete dependency instances, and to manage lifespan instances. During the configuration / bootstrapping process,IoC containers allow the following to be defined:IBar, return aConcreteBar instance"")IDisposable and will take on the responsibility ofDisposing dependencies in line with the configured lifespan management.Typically, once IoC containers have been configured / bootstrapped, they operate seamlessly in the background allowing the coder to focus on the code at hand rather than worrying about dependencies.The key to DI-friendly code is to avoid static coupling of classes, and not to use new() for the creation of DependenciesAs per above example, decoupling of dependencies does require some design effort, and for the developer, there is a paradigm shift needed to break the habit ofnewing dependencies directly, and instead trusting the container to manage dependencies.But the benefits are many, especially in the ability to thoroughly test your class of interest.Note : The creation / mapping / projection (vianew ..()) of POCO / POJO / Serialization DTOs / Entity Graphs / Anonymous JSON projections et al - i.e. ""Data only"" classes or records - used or returned from methods are not regarded as Dependencies (in the UML sense) and not subject to DI. Usingnew to project these is just fine.The whole point of Dependency Injection (DI) is to keep application source code clean and stable:Practically, every design pattern separates concerns to make future changes affect minimum files.The specific domain of DI is delegation of dependency configuration and initialization.If you occasionally work outside of Java, recall howsource is often used in many scripting languages (Shell, Tcl, etc., or evenimport in Python misused for this purpose).Consider simpledependent.sh script:#!/bin/sh# Dependenttouch ""one.txt"" ""two.txt""archive_files ""one.txt"" ""two.txt""The script is dependent: it won\'t execute successfully on its own (archive_files is not defined).You definearchive_files inarchive_files_zip.sh implementation script (usingzip in this case):#!/bin/sh# Dependencyfunction archive_files {zip files.zip ""$@""}Instead ofsource-ing implementation script directly in the dependent one, you use aninjector.sh ""container"" which wraps both ""components"":#!/bin/sh# Injectorsource ./archive_files_zip.shsource ./dependent.shThearchive_files dependency has just been injected into dependent script.You could have injected dependency which implementsarchive_files usingtar orxz.Ifdependent.sh script used dependencies directly, the approach would be called dependency lookup (which is opposite to dependency injection):#!/bin/sh# Dependent# dependency look-upsource ./archive_files_zip.shtouch ""one.txt"" ""two.txt""archive_files ""one.txt"" ""two.txt""Now the problem is that dependent ""component"" has to perform initialization itself.The ""component""\'s source code is neither clean nor stable because every changes in initialization of dependencies requires new release for ""components""\'s source code file as well.DI is not as largely emphasized and popularized as in Java frameworks.But it\'s a generic approach to split concerns of:Using configuration only with dependency lookup does not help as number of configuration parameters may change per dependency (e.g. new authentication type) as well as number of supported types of dependencies (e.g. new database type).All the above answers are good, my aim is to explain the concept in a simple way so that anyone without a programming knowledge can also understand conceptDependency injection is one of the design pattern that help us to create complex systems in a simpler manner.We can see a wide variety of application of this pattern in our day to day life. Some of the examples are Tape recorder, VCD, CD Drive etc.The above image is an image of Reel-to-reel portable tape recorder, mid-20th century. Source.The primary intention of a tape recorder machine is to record or playback sound.While designing a system it require a reel to record or playback sound or music. There are two possibilities for designing this systemIf we use the first one we need to open the machine to change the reel. if we opt for the second one, that is placing a hook for reel, we are getting an added benefit of playing any music by changing the reel. and also reducing the function only to playing whatever in the reel.Like wise dependency injection is the process of externalizing the dependencies to focus only on the specific functionality of the component so that independent components can be coupled together to form a complex system.The main benefits we achieved by using dependency injection.Now a days these concept forms the basis of well known frameworks in programming world. The Spring Angular etc are the well-known software frameworks built on the top of this conceptDependency injection is a pattern used to create instances of objects that other objects rely upon without knowing at compile time which class will be used to provide that functionality or simply the way of injecting properties to an object is called dependency injection.Example for Dependency injectionPreviously we are writing code like thisPublic MyClass{DependentClass dependentObject/*At somewhere in our code we need to instantiatethe object with new operator inorder to use it or perform some method.*/dependentObject= new DependentClass();dependentObject.someMethod();}With Dependency injection, the dependency injector will take off the instantiation for usPublic MyClass{/* Dependency injector will instantiate object*/DependentClass dependentObject/*At somewhere in our code we perform some method.The process of instantiation will be handled by the dependency injector*/dependentObject.someMethod();}You can also readDifference between Inversion of Control & Dependency InjectionExample, we have 2 classClient andService.Client will useServicepublic class Service {public void doSomeThingInService() {// ...}}Way 1)public class Client {public void doSomeThingInClient() {Service service = new Service();service.doSomeThingInService();}}Way 2)public class Client {Service service = new Service();public void doSomeThingInClient() {service.doSomeThingInService();}}Way 3)public class Client {Service service;public Client() {service = new Service();}public void doSomeThingInClient() {service.doSomeThingInService();}}1) 2) 3) UsingClient client = new Client();client.doSomeThingInService();AdvantagesDisadvantagesClient classService constructor, we need to change code in all place createService objectWay 1) Constructor injectionpublic class Client {Service service;Client(Service service) {this.service = service;}// Example Client has 2 dependency// Client(Service service, IDatabas database) {// this.service = service;// this.database = database;// }public void doSomeThingInClient() {service.doSomeThingInService();}}UsingClient client = new Client(new Service());// Client client = new Client(new Service(), new SqliteDatabase());client.doSomeThingInClient();Way 2) Setter injectionpublic class Client {Service service;public void setService(Service service) {this.service = service;}public void doSomeThingInClient() {service.doSomeThingInService();}}UsingClient client = new Client();client.setService(new Service());client.doSomeThingInClient();Way 3) Interface injectionCheck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection===Now, this code is already followDependency Injection and it is easier for testClient class.However, we still usenew Service() many time and it is not good when changeService constructor.

The spring container will be responsible for hooking up all.IOC is a general concept and it can be expressed in many different ways and Dependency Injection is one concrete example of IOC.Constructor-based DI is accomplished when the container invokes a class constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency on other class.public class Triangle {private String type;public String getType(){return type;}public Triangle(String type){ //constructor injectionthis.type=type;}}<bean id=triangle"" class =""com.test.dependencyInjection.Triangle""><constructor-arg value=""20""/></bean>Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean.public class Triangle{private String type;public String getType(){return type;}public void setType(String type){ //setter injectionthis.type = type;}}<!-- setter injection --><bean id=""triangle"" class=""com.test.dependencyInjection.Triangle""><property name=""type"" value=""equivialteral""/>NOTE: It is a good rule of thumb to use constructor arguments for mandatory dependencies and setters for optional dependencies. Note that the if we use annotation based than @Required annotation on a setter can be used to make setters as a required dependencies.The best analogy I can think of is the surgeon and his assistant(s) in an operation theater, where the surgeon is the main person and his assistant who provides the various surgical components when he needs it so that the surgeon can concentrate on the one thing he does best (surgery). Without the assistant the surgeon has to get the components himself every time he needs one.DI for short, is a technique to remove a common additional responsibility (burden) on components to fetch the dependent components, by providing them to it.DI brings you closer to the Single Responsibility (SR) principle, like thesurgeon who can concentrate on surgery.When to use DI : I would recommend using DI in almost all production projects ( small/big), particularly in ever changing business environments :)Why : Because you want your code to be easily testable, mockable etc so that you can quickly test your changes and push it to the market. Besides why would you not when you there are lots of awesome free tools/frameworks to support you in your journey to a codebase where you have more control.It means that objects should only have as many dependencies as is needed to do their job and the dependencies should be few. Furthermore, an object’s dependencies should be on interfaces and not on “concrete” objects, when possible. (A concrete object is any object created with the keyword new.) Loose coupling promotes greater reusability, easier maintainability, and allows you to easily provide “mock” objects in place of expensive services.The “Dependency Injection” (DI) is also known as “Inversion of Control” (IoC), can be used as a technique for encouraging this loose coupling.There are two primary approaches to implementing DI:It’s the technique of passing objects dependencies to its constructor.Note that the constructor accepts an interface and not concrete object. Also, note that an exception is thrown if the orderDao parameter is null. This emphasizes the importance of receiving a valid dependency. Constructor Injection is, in my opinion, the preferred mechanism for giving an object its dependencies. It is clear to the developer while invoking the object which dependencies need to be given to the “Person” object for proper execution.But consider the following example… Suppose you have a class with ten methods that have no dependencies, but you’re adding a new method that does have a dependency on IDAO. You could change the constructor to use Constructor Injection, but this may force you to changes to all constructor calls all over the place. Alternatively, you could just add a new constructor that takes the dependency, but then how does a developer easily know when to use one constructor over the other. Finally, if the dependency is very expensive to create, why should it be created and passed to the constructor when it may only be used rarely? “Setter Injection” is another DI technique that can be used in situations such as this.Setter Injection does not force dependencies to be passed to the constructor. Instead, the dependencies are set onto public properties exposed by the object in need. As implied previously, the primary motivators for doing this include:Here is the example of how the above code would look like:public class Person {public Person() {}public IDAO Address {set { addressdao = value; }get {if (addressdao == null)throw new MemberAccessException(""addressdao"" +"" has not been initialized"");return addressdao;}}public Address GetAddress() {// ... code that uses the addressdao object// to fetch address details from the datasource ...}// Should not be called directly;// use the public property insteadprivate IDAO addressdao;I know there are already many answers, but I found this very helpful: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/dependency-injection/index.htmlpublic class MyDao {protected DataSource dataSource = new DataSourceImpl(""driver"", ""url"", ""user"", ""password"");//data access methods...public Person readPerson(int primaryKey) {...}}public class MyDao {protected DataSource dataSource = null;public MyDao(String driver, String url, String user, String password) {this.dataSource = new DataSourceImpl(driver, url, user, password);}//data access methods...public Person readPerson(int primaryKey) {...}}Notice how theDataSourceImpl instantiation is moved into a constructor. The constructor takes four parameters which are the four values needed by theDataSourceImpl. Though theMyDao class still depends on these four values, it no longer satisfies these dependencies itself. They are provided by whatever class creating aMyDao instance.I think since everyone has written for DI, let me ask a few questions..This is based on the answer @Adam N posted.Why does PersonService no longer have to worry about GroupMembershipService? You just mentioned GroupMembership has multiple things(objects/properties) it depends on. If GMService was required in PService, you\'d have it as a property. You can mock that out regardless of whether you injected it or not. The only time I\'d like it to be injected is if GMService had more specific child classes, which you wouldn\'t know until runtime. Then you\'d want to inject the subclass. Or if you wanted to use that as either singleton or prototype. To be honest, the configuration file has everything hardcoded as far as what subclass for a type (interface) it is going to inject during compile time.EDITA nice comment by Jose Maria Arranz on DIDI increases cohesion by removing any need to determine the direction of dependency and write any glue code.False. The direction of dependencies is in XML form or as annotations, your dependencies are written as XML code and annotations. XML and annotations ARE source code.DI reduces coupling by making all of your components modular (i.e. replaceable) and have well-defined interfaces to each other.False. You do not need a DI framework to build a modular code based on interfaces.About replaceable: with a very simple .properties archive and Class.forName you can define which classes can change. If ANY class of your code can be changed, Java is not for you, use an scripting language. By the way: annotations cannot be changed without recompiling.In my opinion there is one only reason for DI frameworks: boiler plate reduction. With a well done factory system you can do the same, more controlled and more predictable as your preferred DI framework, DI frameworks promise code reduction (XML and annotations are source code too). The problem is this boiler plate reduction is just real in very very simple cases (one instance-per class and similar), sometimes in the real world picking the appropriated service object is not as easy as mapping a class to a singleton object.Dependency Injection means a way (actually any-way) for one part of code (e.g a class) to have access to dependencies (other parts of code, e.g other classes, it depends upon) in a modular way without them being hardcoded (so they can change or be overriden freely, or even be loaded at another time, as needed)(and ps , yes it has become an overly-hyped 25$ name for a rather simple, concept), my.25 centsThe popular answers are unhelpful, because they define dependency injection in a way that isn\'t useful. Let\'s agree that by ""dependency"" we mean some pre-existing other object that our object X needs. But we don\'t say we\'re doing ""dependency injection"" when we say$foo = Foo->new($bar);We just call that passing parameters into the constructor. We\'ve been doing that regularly ever since constructors were invented.""Dependency injection"" is considered a type of ""inversion of control"", which means that some logic is taken out of the caller. That isn\'t the case when the caller passes in parameters, so if that were DI, DI would not imply inversion of control.DI means there is an intermediate level between the caller and the constructor which manages dependencies. A Makefile is a simple example of dependency injection. The ""caller"" is the person typing ""make bar"" on the command line, and the ""constructor"" is the compiler. The Makefile specifies that bar depends on foo, and it does agcc -c foo.cpp; gcc -c bar.cppbefore doing agcc foo.o bar.o -o barThe person typing ""make bar"" doesn\'t need to know that bar depends on foo. The dependency was injected between ""make bar"" and gcc.The main purpose of the intermediate level is not just to pass in the dependencies to the constructor, but to list all the dependencies in just one place, and to hide them from the coder (not to make the coder provide them).Usually the intermediate level provides factories for the constructed objects, which must provide a role that each requested object type must satisfy. That\'s because by having an intermediate level that hides the details of construction, you\'ve already incurred the abstraction penalty imposed by factories, so you might as well use factories.From the Book, \'Well-Grounded Java Developer: Vital techniques of Java 7 and polyglot programmingDI is a particular form of IoC, whereby the process of finding your dependencies is outside the direct control of your currently executing code.Dependency injection is one possible solution to what could generally be termed the ""Dependency Obfuscation"" requirement. Dependency Obfuscation is a method of taking the \'obvious\' nature out of the process of providing a dependency to a class that requires it and therefore obfuscating, in some way, the provision of said dependency to said class. This is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, by obfuscating the manner by which a dependency is provided to a class then something outside the class is responsible for creating the dependency which means, in various scenarios, a different implementation of the dependency can be supplied to the class without making any changes to the class. This is great for switching between production and testing modes (eg., using a \'mock\' service dependency).Unfortunately the bad part is that some people have assumed you need a specialized framework to do dependency obfuscation and that you are somehow a \'lesser\' programmer if you choose not to use a particular framework to do it. Another, extremely disturbing myth, believed by many, is that dependency injection is the only way of achieving dependency obfuscation. This is demonstrably and historically and obviously 100% wrong but you will have trouble convincing some people that there are alternatives to dependency injection for your dependency obfuscation requirements.Programmers have understood the dependency obfuscation requirement for years and many alternative solutions have evolved both before and after dependency injection was conceived. There are Factory patterns but there are also many options using ThreadLocal where no injection to a particular instance is needed - the dependency is effectively injected into the thread which has the benefit of making the object available (via convenience static getter methods) to any class that requires it without having to add annotations to the classes that require it and set up intricate XML \'glue\' to make it happen. When your dependencies are required for persistence (JPA/JDO or whatever) it allows you to achieve \'tranaparent persistence\' much easier and with domain model and business model classes made up purely of POJOs (i.e. no framework specific/locked in annotations).Dependency Injection for 5 year olds.When you go and get things out of the refrigerator for yourself, you can cause problems. You might leave the door open, you might get something Mommy or Daddy doesn\'t want you to have. You might be even looking for something we don\'t even have or which has expired.What you should be doing is stating a need, ""I need something to drink with lunch,"" and then we will make sure you have something when you sit down to eat.In simple words dependency injection (DI) is the way to remove dependencies or tight coupling between different object. Dependency Injection gives a cohesive behavior to each object.DI is the implementation of IOC principal of Spring which says ""Don\'t call us we will call you"". Using dependency injection programmer doesn\'t need to create object using the new keyword.Objects are once loaded in Spring container and then we reuse them whenever we need them by fetching those objects from Spring container using getBean(String beanName) method.from Book Apress.Spring.Persistence.with.Hibernate.Oct.2010The purpose of dependency injection is to decouple the work of resolving external software components from your application business logic.Without dependency injection, the details of how a component accesses required services can get muddled in with the component’s code. This not only increases the potential for errors, adds code bloat, and magnifies maintenance complexities; it couples components together more closely, making it difficult to modify dependencies when refactoring or testing.Dependency Injection (DI) is part of Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) practice, which is also called Inversion of Control (IoC). Basically you need to do DIP because you want to make your code more modular and unit testable, instead of just one monolithic system. So you start identifying parts of the code that can be separated from the class and abstracted away. Now the implementation of the abstraction need to be injected from outside of the class. Normally this can be done via constructor. So you create a constructor that accepts the abstraction as a parameter, and this is called dependency injection (via constructor). For more explanation about DIP, DI, and IoC container you can read HereDependency Injection (DI) is one from Design Patterns, which uses the basic feature of OOP - the relationship in one object with another object. While inheritance inherits one object to do more complex and specific another object, relationship or association simply creates a pointer to another object from one object using attribute. The power of DI is in combination with other features of OOP as are interfaces and hiding code. Suppose, we have a customer (subscriber) in the library, which can borrow only one book for simplicity.Interface of book:package com.deepam.hidden;public interface BookInterface {public BookInterface setHeight(int height);public BookInterface setPages(int pages);public int getHeight();public int getPages();public String toString();}Next we can have many kind of books; one of type is fiction:package com.deepam.hidden;public class FictionBook implements BookInterface {int height = 0; // height in cmint pages = 0; // number of pages/** constructor */public FictionBook() {// TODO Auto-generated constructor stub}@Overridepublic FictionBook setHeight(int height) {this.height = height;return this;}@Overridepublic FictionBook setPages(int pages) {this.pages = pages;return this;}@Overridepublic int getHeight() {// TODO Auto-generated method stubreturn height;}@Overridepublic int getPages() {// TODO Auto-generated method stubreturn pages;}@Overridepublic String toString(){return (""height: "" + height + "", "" + ""pages: "" + pages);}}Now subscriber can have association to the book:package com.deepam.hidden;import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException;public class Subscriber {BookInterface book;/** constructor*/public Subscriber() {// TODO Auto-generated constructor stub}// injection Ipublic void setBook(BookInterface book) {this.book = book;}// injection IIpublic BookInterface setBook(String bookName) {try {Class<?> cl = Class.forName(bookName);Constructor<?> constructor = cl.getConstructor(); // use it for parameters in constructorBookInterface book = (BookInterface) constructor.newInstance();//book = (BookInterface) Class.forName(bookName).newInstance();} catch (InstantiationException e) {e.printStackTrace();} catch (IllegalAccessException e) {e.printStackTrace();} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {e.printStackTrace();} catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {e.printStackTrace();} catch (SecurityException e) {e.printStackTrace();} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {e.printStackTrace();} catch (InvocationTargetException e) {e.printStackTrace();}return book;}public BookInterface getBook() {return book;}public static void main(String[] args) {}}All the three classes can be hidden for it\'s own implementation. Now we can use this code for DI:package com.deepam.implement;import com.deepam.hidden.Subscriber;import com.deepam.hidden.FictionBook;public class CallHiddenImplBook {public CallHiddenImplBook() {// TODO Auto-generated constructor stub}public void doIt() {Subscriber ab = new Subscriber();// injection IFictionBook bookI = new FictionBook();bookI.setHeight(30); // cmbookI.setPages(250);ab.setBook(bookI); // injectSystem.out.println(""injection I "" + ab.getBook().toString());// injection IIFictionBook bookII = ((FictionBook) ab.setBook(""com.deepam.hidden.FictionBook"")).setHeight(5).setPages(108); // inject and setSystem.out.println(""injection II "" + ab.getBook().toString());}public static void main(String[] args) {CallHiddenImplBook kh = new CallHiddenImplBook();kh.doIt();}}There are many different ways how to use dependency injection. It is possible to combine it with Singleton, etc., but still in basic it is only association realized by creating attribute of object type inside another object. The usefulness is only and only in feature, that code, which we should write again and again is always prepared and done for us forward. This is why DI so closely binded with Inversion of Control (IoC) which means, that our program passes control another running module, which does injections of beans to our code. (Each object, which can be injected can be signed or considered as a Bean.) For example in Spring it is done by creating and initialization ApplicationContext container, which does this work for us. We simply in our code create the Context and invoke initialization the beans. In that moment injection has been done automatically.I would propose a slightly different, short and precise definition of what Dependency Injection is, focusing on the primary goal, not on the technical means (following along from here):Dependency Injection is the process of creating the static, stateless graph of service objects, where each service is parametrised by its dependencies.The objects that we create in our applications (regardless if we use Java, C# or other object-oriented language) usually fall into one of two categories: stateless, static and global “service objects” (modules), and stateful, dynamic and local “data objects”.The module graph - the graph of service objects - is typically created on application startup. This can be done using a container, such as Spring, but can also be done manually, by passing parameters to object constructors. Both ways have their pros and cons, but a framework definitely isn’t necessary to use DI in your application.One requirement is that the services must be parametrised by their dependencies. What this means exactly depends on the language and approach taken in a given system. Usually, this takes the form of constructor parameters, but using setters is also an option. This also means that the dependencies of a service are hidden (when invoking a service method) from the users of the service.When to use? I would say whenever the application is large enough that encapsulating logic into separate modules, with a dependency graph between the modules gives a gain in readability and explorability of the code.', 'url': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/130794/what-is-dependency-injection', 'cleaned_text': 'There have been several questions already posted with specific questions about dependency injection, such as when to use it and what frameworks are there for it. However,What is dependency injection and when/why should or shouldn\'t it be used?\n\nThe best definition I\'ve found so far is one by James Shore:\n""Dependency Injection"" is a 25-dollar term for a 5-cent concept. [...] Dependency injection means giving an object its instance variables. [...].\nThere is an article by Martin Fowler that may prove useful, too.\n\nDependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself. It\'s a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out.\n\nDependencies can be injected into objects by many means (such as constructor injection or setter injection). One can even use specialized dependency injection frameworks (e.g. Spring) to do that, but they certainly aren\'t required. You don\'t need those frameworks to have dependency injection. Instantiating and passing objects (dependencies) explicitly is just as good an injection as injection by framework.\n\nDependency Injection is passing dependency to other objects or framework( dependency injector).\nDependency injection makes testing easier. The injection can be done through constructor.\nSomeClass() has its constructor as following:\npublic SomeClass() {myObject = Factory.getObject();}\n\nProblem:\nIfmyObject involves complex tasks such as disk access or network access, it is hard to do unit test onSomeClass(). Programmers have to mockmyObject and might intercept the factory call.\n\nAlternative solution:\nmyObject in as an argument to the constructor\npublic SomeClass (MyClass myObject) {this.myObject = myObject;}\nmyObject can be passed directly which makes testing easier.\nIt is harder to isolate components in unit testing without dependency injection.\nIn 2013, when I wrote this answer, this was a major theme on the Google Testing Blog. It remains the biggest advantage to me, as programmers not always need the extra flexibility in their run-time design (for instance, for service locator or similar patterns). Programmers often need to isolate the classes during testing.\n\nI found this funny example in terms of loose coupling:\nSource: Understanding dependency injection\nAny application is composed of many objects that collaborate with each other to perform some useful stuff. Traditionally each object is responsible for obtaining its own references to the dependent objects (dependencies) it collaborate with. This leads to highly coupled classes and hard-to-test code.\n\nFor example, consider aCar object.\nACar depends on wheels, engine, fuel, battery, etc. to run. Traditionally we define the brand of such dependent objects along with the definition of theCar object.\n\nWithout Dependency Injection (DI):\nclass Car{private Wheel wh = new NepaliRubberWheel();private Battery bt = new ExcideBattery();//The rest}\nHere, theCar object is responsible for creating the dependent objects.\nWhat if we want to change the type of its dependent object - sayWheel - after the initialNepaliRubberWheel() punctures?\nWe need to recreate the Car object with its new dependency sayChineseRubberWheel(), but only theCar manufacturer can do that.\n\nThen what does theDependency Injection do for us...?\nWhen using dependency injection, objects are given their dependencies at run time rather than compile time (car manufacturing time).\nSo that we can now change theWheel whenever we want. Here, thedependency (wheel) can be injected intoCar at run time.\n\nAfter using dependency injection:\nHere, we are injecting the dependencies (Wheel and Battery) at runtime. Hence the term : Dependency Injection. We normally rely on DI frameworks such as Spring, Guice, Weld to create the dependencies and inject where needed.\nclass Car{private Wheel wh; // Inject an Instance of Wheel (dependency of car) at runtimeprivate Battery bt; // Inject an Instance of Battery (dependency of car) at runtimeCar(Wheel wh,Battery bt) {this.wh = wh;this.bt = bt;}//Or we can have settersvoid setWheel(Wheel wh) {this.wh = wh;}}\n\nThe advantages are:new a tire? I don\'t. All I have to do is to buy (inject via param) from them, install and wah-lah! So, coming back to programming, say a C# project needs to use an existing library/class, there are two ways to run/debug, 1-add reference to the entire project of thisnew it, option 2 is pass it in as param. May not be accurate, but simple stupid easy to understand.\n\nDependency Injection is a practice where objects are designed in a manner where they receive instances of the objects from other pieces of code, instead of constructing them internally. This means that any object implementing the interface which is required by the object can be substituted in without changing the code, which simplifies testing, and improves decoupling.\n\nFor example, consider these clases:\npublic class PersonService {public void addManager( Person employee, Person newManager ) { ... }public void removeManager( Person employee, Person oldManager ) { ... }public Group getGroupByManager( Person manager ) { ... }}\npublic class GroupMembershipService() {public void addPersonToGroup( Person person, Group group ) { ... }public void removePersonFromGroup( Person person, Group group ) { ... }}\nIn this example, the implementation ofPersonService::addManager andPersonService::removeManager would need an instance of theGroupMembershipService in order to do its work. Without Dependency Injection, the traditional way of doing this would be to instantiate a newGroupMembershipService in the constructor ofPersonService and use that instance attribute in both functions. However, if the constructor ofGroupMembershipService has multiple things it requires, or worse yet, there are some initialization ""setters"" that need to be called on theGroupMembershipService, the code grows rather quickly, and thePersonService now depends not only on theGroupMembershipService but also everything else thatGroupMembershipService depends on. Furthermore, the linkage toGroupMembershipService is hardcoded into thePersonService which means that you can\'t ""dummy up"" aGroupMembershipService for testing purposes, or to use a strategy pattern in different parts of your application.\n\nWith Dependency Injection, instead of instantiating theGroupMembershipService within yourPersonService, you\'d either pass it in to thePersonService constructor, or else add a Property (getter and setter) to set a local instance of it. This means that yourPersonService no longer has to worry about how to create aGroupMembershipService, it just accepts the ones it\'s given, and works with them. This also means that anything which is a subclass ofGroupMembershipService, or implements theGroupMembershipService interface can be ""injected"" into thePersonService, and thePersonService doesn\'t need to know about the change.\n\nThe accepted answer is a good one - but I would like to add to this that DI is very much like the classic avoiding of hardcoded constants in the code.\nWhen you use some constant like a database name you\'d quickly move it from the inside of the code to some config file and pass a variable containing that value to the place where it is needed. The reason to do that is that these constants usually change more frequently than the rest of the code. For example if you\'d like to test the code in a test database.\n\nDI is analogous to this in the world of Object Oriented programming. The values there instead of constant literals are whole objects - but the reason to move the code creating them out from the class code is similar - the objects change more frequently then the code that uses them. One important case where such a change is needed is tests.\n\nLet\'s'}, {'raw_text': 'Since learning (and loving) automated testing I have found myself using the dependency injection pattern in almost every project. Is it always appropriate to use this pattern when working with automated testing? Are there any situations were you should avoid using dependency injection?-2Related (probably not duplicate) - stackoverflow.com/questions/2407540/…– user8709Feb 21, 2012 at 19:25-3Sounds a little bit like the Golden Hammer anti-pattern. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern– CugaOct 1, 2013 at 19:3810 AnswersBasically, dependency injection makes some (usually but not always valid) assumptions about the nature of your objects. If those are wrong, DI may not be the best solution:First, most basically, DI assumes that tight coupling of object implementations is ALWAYS bad. This is the essence of the Dependency Inversion Principle: ""a dependency should never be made upon a concretion; only upon an abstraction"".This closes the dependent object to change based on a change to the concrete implementation; a class depending upon ConsoleWriter specifically will need to change if output needs to go to a file instead, but if the class were dependent only on an IWriter exposing a Write() method, we can replace the ConsoleWriter currently being used with a FileWriter and our dependent class wouldn\'t know the difference (Liskhov Substitution Principle).However, a design can NEVER be closed to all types of change; if the design of the IWriter interface itself changes, to add a parameter to Write(), an extra code object (the IWriter interface) must now be changed, on top of the implementation object/method and its usage(s). If changes in the actual interface are more likely than changes to the implementation of said interface, loose coupling (and DI-ing loosely-coupled dependencies) can cause more problems than it solves.Second, and corollary, DI assumes that the dependent class is NEVER a good place to create a dependency. This goes to the Single Responsibility Principle; if you have code which creates a dependency and also uses it, then there are two reasons the dependent class may have to change (a change to the usage OR the implementation), violating SRP.However, again, adding layers of indirection for DI can be a solution to a problem that doesn\'t exist; if it is logical to encapsulate logic in a dependency, but that logic is the only such implementation of a dependency, then it is more painful to code the loosely-coupled resolution of the dependency (injection, service location, factory) than it would be to just usenewand forget about it.Lastly, DI by its nature centralizes knowledge of all dependencies AND their implementations. This increases the number of references that the assembly which performs the injection must have, and in most cases does NOT reduce the number of references required by actual dependent classes\' assemblies.SOMETHING, SOMEWHERE, must have knowledge of the dependent, the dependency interface, and the dependency implementation in order to ""connect the dots"" and satisfy that dependency. DI tends to place all that knowledge at a very high level, either in an IoC container, or in the code that creates ""main"" objects such as the main form or Controller which must hydrate (or provide factory methods for) the dependencies. This can put a lot of necessarily tightly-coupled code and a lot of assembly references at high levels of your app, which only needs this knowledge in order to ""hide"" it from the actual dependent classes (which from a very basic perspective is the best place to have this knowledge; where it\'s used).It also normally doesn\'t remove said references from lower down in code; a dependent must still reference the library containing the interface for its dependency, which is in one of three places:- all in a single ""Interfaces"" assembly that becomes very application-centric,- each one alongside the primary implementation(s), removing the advantage of not having to recompile dependents when dependencies change, or- one or two apiece in highly-cohesive assemblies, which bloats the assembly count, dramatically increases ""full build"" times and decreases application performance.All of this, again to solve a problem in places where there may be none.-1SRP = single responsibility principle, for anyone else wondering. Feb 22, 2012 at 17:26-1Yes, and LSP is the Liskov Substitution principle; given a dependency on A, the dependency should be able to be met by B which derives from A without any other change.– KeithSFeb 22, 2012 at 17:29-the dependency injection specifically help where you need to get class A from class B from class D etc. in that case ( and only that case) the DI framework may generate less assembly bloat than poor\'s man injection. also I never had a bottleneck caused by DI.. think to maintenance cost, never to cpu cost because code can always be optimized , but doing that without a reason has a cost Dec 1, 2014 at 23:05-Would another assumption be ""if a dependancy changes it changes everywhere""? Or else you have to look at all consuming classes anyway Oct 25, 2015 at 10:14-5This answer fails to address the testability impact of injecting dependencies versus hardcoding them. See also the Explicit Dependencies Principle (deviq.com/explicit-dependencies-principle )– ssmithMay 25, 2017 at 18:43Outside of dependency-injection frameworks, dependency injection (via constructor injection or setter injection) is very nearly a zero-sum game: you decrease the coupling between object A and it\'s dependency B, but now any object that needs an instance of A must now also construct object B.You\'ve slightly reduced the coupling between A and B, but reduced A\'s encapsulation, and increased coupling between A and any class that must construct an instance of A, by coupling them to A\'s dependencies as well.So dependency injection (without a framework) is about equally harmful as it is helpful.The extra cost is often easily justifiable, however: if the client code knows more about how to construct the dependency than the object itself does, then dependency injection really does reduce coupling; for example, a Scanner doesn\'t know much about how to obtain or construct an input stream to parse input from, or what source the client code wants to parse input from, so constructor injection of an input stream is the obvious solution.Testing is another justification, in order to be able to use mock dependencies. That should mean adding an extra constructor used for testing only that allows dependencies to be injected: if you instead change your constructors to always require dependencies to be injected, suddenly, you have to know about your dependencies\' dependencies\' dependencies in order to construct your direct dependencies, and you can\'t get any work done.It can be helpful, but you should definitely ask yourself for each dependency, is the testing benefit worth the cost, and am I really going to want to mock this dependency while testing?When a dependency-injection framework is added, and the construction of dependencies is delegated not to client code but instead to the framework, the cost/benefit analysis changes greatly.In a dependency-injection framework, the tradeoffs are a bit different; what you\'re losing by injecting a dependency is the ability to know easily what implementation you are relying on, and shifting the responsibility for deciding what dependency you are relying on to some automated resolution process (e.g. if we require an @Inject\'ed Foo, there must be something that @Provides Foo, and whose injected dependencies are available), or to some high-level configuration file that prescribes what provider should be used for each resource, or to some hybrid of the two (for example, there may be an automated resolution process for dependencies that can be overridden, if necessary, using a configuration file).As in constructor injection, I think the advantage of doing so ends up, again, being very similar to the cost of doing so: you don\'t have to know who is providing the data you rely on, and, if there are multiple potential providers, you don\'t have to know the preferred order to check for providers in, make sure that every location that needs the data checks for all potential providers, etc., because all of that is handled at a high level by the dependency injection platform.While I don\'t personally have a great deal of experience with DI frameworks, my impression is that they provide more benefit than cost when the headache of finding the correct provider of the data or service that you need has a higher cost than the headache, when something fails, of not immediately knowing locally what code provided the bad data that caused a later failure in your code.In some cases, other patterns that obscure dependencies (e.g. service locators) had already been adopted (and perhaps also proven their worth) when DI frameworks appeared on the scene, and the DI frameworks were adopted because they offered some competitive advantage, such as requiring less boilerplate code, or potentially doing less to obscure the provider of dependency when it becomes necessary to determine what provider is actually in use.-9Just a quick comment about the dependency mocking in tests and ""you have to know about your dependencies\' dependencies\' dependencies""... That\'s not true at all. One does not need to know or care about some concrete implementation\'s dependencies if a mock is being injected. One only needs to know about the direct dependencies of the class under test, which are satisfied by the mock(s). Feb 21, 2012 at 21:36-10You misunderstand, I\'m not talking about when you inject a mock, I\'m talking about the real code. Consider class A with dependency B, which in turn has dependency C, which in turn has dependency D. Without DI, A constructs B, B constructs C, C constructs D. With construction injection, to construct A, you must first construct B, to construct B you must first construct C, and to construct C you must first construct D. So class A now has to know about D, the dependency of a dependency of a dependency, in order to construct B. This leads to excessive coupling. Feb 22, 2012 at 16:33-6Dependency injection dosent only move dependencies around in a zero sum game. You move your dependencirs to places they already exist: the main project. You can even use convention-based approaches to make sure the dependencies are only resolved at run time, for instance by specifying which classes are concrete by namespaces or whatever. I have to say this is a naive answer– SpragueApr 24, 2016 at 11:22-5@Sprague Dependency injection moves around dependencies in a slightly negative-sum game, if you apply it in cases where it shouldn\'t be applied. The purpose of this answer is to remind people that dependency injection is not inherently good, it is a design pattern that is incredibly useful in the right circumstances, but an unjustifiable cost in normal circumstances (at least in the programming domains I\'ve worked in, I understand in some domains it\'s more frequently useful than in others). DI sometimes becomes a buzzword and an end in itself, which misses the point. Apr 25, 2016 at 20:14-2Having constructors that expose dependencies ""only for tests"" doesn\'t work if you\'re trying to test any other code that references the non-testable constructor, unfortunately.– ssmithMay 25, 2017 at 18:45if you are creating database entities, you should rather have some factory class which you will inject instead to your controller,if you need to create primitive objects like ints or longs. Also you should create ""by hand"" most of the standard library objects like dates, guids, etc.if you would like to inject configuration strings it\'s probably better idea to inject some configuration objects (in general it is recommended to wrap simple types into meaningful objects: int temperatureInCelsiusDegrees -> CelciusDeegree temperature)And don\'t use Service locator as dependency injection alternative, it\'s anti-pattern, more info: http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorIsAnAntiPattern.aspx-All the points are about using different form of injection rather than not using it altogether. +1 for the link though. Sep 23, 2013 at 15:02-3Service Locator is NOT an anti-pattern and the guy who\'s blog you linked to is not an expert in patterns. That he got StackExchange-famous is kind of a disservice to software design. Martin Fowler (author of staple Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture) has a more reasonable view on the matter: martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html Apr 11, 2016 at 21:52-3@Colin, on the contrary, Service Locator is most definitely an anti-pattern, and here in a nutshell is the reason why. Jul 29, 2019 at 14:50-@Kyralessa - you realize that DI frameworks internally use a Service Locator pattern to look up services, right? There are circumstances where both are appropriate, and neither are an anti pattern despite the StackExchange hate some people want to dump. Jul 29, 2019 at 18:38-Sure, and my car internally uses pistons and spark plugs and a host of other things which are not, however, a good interface for an ordinary human being who just wants to drive a car. Jul 30, 2019 at 7:30When you don\'t stand to gain anything by making your project maintainable and testable.Seriously, I love IoC and DI in general, and I\'d say that 98% of the time I will use that pattern without fail. It\'s especially important in a multi-user environment, where you code can be reused again and again by different team members and different projects, as it separates logic from implementation. Logging is a prime example of this, an ILog interface injected into a class is a thousand times more maintainable than simply plugging in your logging framework-du-jour, as you have no guarantee another project will use the same logging framework (if it uses one at all!).However, there are times when it is not an applicable pattern. For example, functional entry points that are implemented in a static context by a non-overridable initialiser (WebMethods, I\'m looking at you, but your Main() method in your Program class is another example) simply cannot have dependencies injected at initialisation time. I\'d also go as far as to say that a prototype, or any throw-away investigative piece of code, is also a bad candidate; the benefits of DI are pretty much mid-to-long-term benefits (testability and maintainability), if you are certain that you will throw away the majority of a piece of code within a week or so I would say you gain nothing by isolating dependencies, just spend the time you\'d normally spend testing and isolating dependencies getting the code working.All in all, it\'s sensible to take a pragmatic approach to any methodology or pattern, as nothing is applicable 100% of the time.One thing to note is your comment about automated testing: my definition of this is automated functional tests, for example scripted selenium tests if you are in a web context. These are generally completely black-box tests, with no need to know about the inner workings of the code. If you were referring to Unit- or Integration-tests I\'d say that the DI pattern is almost always applicable to any project that heavily relies on that kind of white-box testing, since, for example, it allows you to test things like methods that touch the DB without any need for a DB to be present.-I don\'t understand what you mean about logging. Surely all loggers aren\'t going to conform to the same interface so you\'d have to write your own wrapper to translate between this projects way of logging and a specific logger (assuming you wanted to be able to easily change loggers). So after that what does DI give you? Oct 25, 2015 at 10:27-@RichardTingle I\'d say that you should define your logging wrapper as an interface, and then you write an lightweight implementation of that interface for each external logging service, instead of using a single logging class that wraps multiple abstractions. It\'s the same concept you\'re proposing but abstracted at a different level.– Ed JamesOct 28, 2015 at 16:03-DI can help testability in a compiled language by enabling mocking. In an interpreted language, mocking comes out of the box, so this aspect of DI is not a valid argument in the context of interpreted languages. Jan 17, 2022 at 22:40I suggest you to try to use just basic OOP principles: use inheritance to extract common functionality, encapsulate/hide things that should be protected from outside world using private/internal/protected members/types. Use any powerful enough test-framework to inject code for tests only, for example https://www.typemock.com/ or https://www.telerik.com/products/mocking.aspx .Next, try to re-write that using DI and then compare the code. What you will usually see having DI:- You have more interfaces (more types)- You\'ve created signature duplicates of your public methods and you will have to double maintain it (you can\'t simply change a parameter once, you will have to do it twice. Basically all refactoring and navigational possibilities become more complicated with DI)- You exchanged some of compilation errors to runtime failures (with DI it\'s easy to ignore a missing dependency while coding, and not surely it is going to be exposed when testing)- You\'ve uncovered your encapsulation. Now protected members,internal types and others have became public- Overall code-base is bigger with DIFrom what I\'ve seen, almost always, code quality goes down with DI.However, if you use only ""public"" access modifier in class declaration, and/or public/private modifiers for members, and/or you don\'t have a choice to buy expensive test tools and same time you need unit testing that can\'t be replaced by integrational testing, and/or you already have interfaces for the classes you are thinking to inject, DI is a good choice! It works great where plugins are required, for instance.p.s. probably I will get number of minuses for this post, but I believe that\'s because of most modern developers just don\'t care about how and why to use internal keyword, for example, or how to decrease coupling of your components and finally why to decrease it. Eventually, just try to code and compare.-1I don\'t know about minuses, but I would give additional pluses if I could.– fooJan 17 at 13:49-1@foo thank you for reminding. I have fixed the answer slightly. Just improved English and language style mostly. Jan 20 at 9:47While the other answers focus on the technical aspects I would like to add a practical dimension.Over the years I came to a conclusion that there are several practical requirements that need to be met if introducing Dependency Injection is to be a success.There should be a reason to introduce it.This sounds obvious, but if your code only gets things from the database and returns it without any logic then adding a DI container makes things more complex with not real benefit. Integration testing would be more important here.The team needs to be trained and on board.Unless the majority of the team is on board and understands DI adding inversion of control container becomes a yet another way to do things and made the code base even more complicated.If the DI is introduced by a new member of the team, because they understand it and like it and just want to show that they are good, AND the team is not actively involved, there is a real risk that it will actually decrease quality of the code.You need to testWhile decoupling is generally a good thing, DI can move resolution of a dependency from compile time to run time. This is actually quite dangerous if you don\'t test well. Run time resolution failures can be costly to track and resolve.(It is clear from your test that you do, but many teams don\'t test to the extent that is required by DI.)This is not a complete answer, but just another point.When you have an application that start once, runs for a long time (like a web app) DI might be good.When you have an application that starts many times and runs for shorter times (like a mobile app) you probably do not want the container.-I don’t see how live time of application related to DI May 14, 2018 at 22:21-@MichaelFreidgeim It takes time to initialise the the context, usually DI containers are quite heavy, such as Spring. Make a hello world app with just one class and make one with Spring and start both 10 times and you will see what I mean. May 14, 2018 at 23:43-It sound like an issue with an individual DI container. In .Net world I haven’t heard about initialisation time as an essential problem for DI containers May 16, 2018 at 21:58An alternative to Dependency Injection is using a Service Locator. A Service Locator is easier to understand, debug, and makes constructing an object simpler especially if you aren\'t using a DI framework. Service Locators are a good pattern for managing external static dependencies, for instance a database that you would otherwise have to pass into every object in your data access layer.When refactoring legacy code, it is often easier to refactor to a Service Locator than to Dependency Injection. All you do is replace instantiations with service lookups and then fake out the service in your unit test.However, there are some downsides to the Service Locator. Knowing the depandancies of a class is more difficult because the dependencies are hidden in the class\'s implementation, not in constructors or setters. And creating two objects that rely on different implementations of the same service is difficult or impossible.TLDR: If your class has static dependencies or you are refactoring legacy code, a Service Locator is arguably better than DI.-12The Service Locator hides dependencies in your code. It\'s not a good pattern to use. Feb 20, 2012 at 23:10-1When it comes to static dependencies, I\'d rather see facades slapped on them that implement interfaces. These can then be dependency injected, and they fall on the static grenade for you. Feb 21, 2012 at 0:26-@Kyralessa I agree, a Service Locator has many downsides and DI is almost always preferable. However, I believe there are a couple exceptions to the rule, as with all programming principles. Feb 21, 2012 at 14:13-Service location\'s main accepted use is within a Strategy pattern, where a ""strategy picker"" class is given enough logic to find the strategy to use, and either hand it back or pass a call through to it. Even in this case, the strategy picker can be a facade for a factory method provided by an IoC container, which is given the same logic; the reason you\'d break it out is to put logic where it belongs and not where it\'s most hidden.– KeithSFeb 21, 2012 at 19:18-2To quote Martin Fowler, ""The choice between (DI and Service Locator) is less important than the principle of separating configuration from use"". The idea that DI is ALWAYS better is hogwash. If a service is used globally, it\'s more cumbersome and brittle to use DI. Additionally, DI is less favorable for plugin architectures where implementations aren\'t known till runtime. Think how awkward it would be to always pass additional arguments to Debug.WriteLine() and the like! Apr 11, 2016 at 21:35There\'s an scenario which not a lot of people seems to notice. Say we have the canonical calculator:class Calculator{public Calculator (TrigonometryEngine trigonometryEngine ) {_trigonometryEngine = trigonometryEngine;}public decimal CosineOf(Radian radians) {return _trigonometryEngine.CosineOf(radians);}}If we were to package this silly type as a library, it would impose a requirement on the consumer to understand how to build aTrigonometryEngine. However, theTrigonometryEngine is only an implementation detail and should not be included in the shipping API unless there is a clear motivation from the library writer that it can be replaced by consumers to adhere to the well known open-close principle. Otherwise, adding it to the API surface would only expand it unnecessarily, serving no other purpose than to facilitate smoother unit testing.This aspect is systematically overlooked. Quite often, this leads to tests coupled to implementation details, ossifying the types relationships and making refactoring much more complex, as test safety net will become red for the wrong reasons.I don\'t see this argument in other answers, so I\'ll add it.Most dependency injection frameworks are multi-threaded solutions. Therefore, you should not use dependency injection with static classes that are not tread safe by default. First, make them tread safe.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5839974/are-static-classes-thread-safeStatic constructor leads to The Ambient Context Anti-Pattern:https://freecontent.manning.com/the-ambient-context-anti-pattern/Ambient Context Anti-Pattern exploits many of the disadvantages discussed in other answers.', 'url': 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/135971/when-is-it-not-appropriate-to-use-the-dependency-injection-pattern', 'cleaned_text': 'Since learning (and loving) automated testing I have found myself using the dependency injection pattern in almost every project. Is it always appropriate to use this pattern when working with automated testing? Are there any situations were you should avoid using dependency injection?\n\nBasically, dependency injection makes some (usually but not always valid) assumptions about the nature of your objects. If those are wrong, DI may not be the best solution:\n\nFirst, most basically, DI assumes that tight coupling of object implementations is ALWAYS bad. This is the essence of the Dependency Inversion Principle: ""a dependency should never be made upon a concretion; only upon an abstraction"".\n\nThis closes the dependent object to change based on a change to the concrete implementation; a class depending upon ConsoleWriter specifically will need to change if output needs to go to a file instead, but if the class were dependent only on an IWriter exposing a Write() method, we can replace the ConsoleWriter currently being used with a FileWriter and our dependent class wouldn\'t know the difference (Liskhov Substitution Principle).\nHowever, a design can NEVER be closed to all types of change; if the design of the IWriter interface itself changes, to add a parameter to Write(), an extra code object (the IWriter interface) must now be changed, on top of the implementation object/method and its usage(s). If changes in the actual interface are more likely than changes to the implementation of said interface, loose coupling (and DI-ing loosely-coupled dependencies) can cause more problems than it solves.\n\nSecond, and corollary, DI assumes that the dependent class is NEVER a good place to create a dependency. This goes to the Single Responsibility Principle; if you have code which creates a dependency and also uses it, then there are two reasons the dependent class may have to change (a change to the usage OR the implementation), violating SRP.\n\nHowever, again, adding layers of indirection for DI can be a solution to a problem that doesn\'t exist; if it is logical to encapsulate logic in a dependency, but that logic is the only such implementation of a dependency, then it is more painful to code the loosely-coupled resolution of the dependency (injection, service location, factory) than it would be to just use new and forget about it.\nLastly, DI by its nature centralizes knowledge of all dependencies AND their implementations. This increases the number of references that the assembly which performs the injection must have, and in most cases does NOT reduce the number of references required by actual dependent classes\' assemblies.\n\nSOMETHING, SOMEWHERE, must have knowledge of the dependent, the dependency interface, and the dependency implementation in order to ""connect the dots"" and satisfy that dependency. DI tends to place all that knowledge at a very high level, either in an IoC container, or in the code that creates ""main"" objects such as the main form or Controller which must hydrate (or provide factory methods for) the dependencies. This can put a lot of necessarily tightly-coupled code and a lot of assembly references at high levels of your app, which only needs this knowledge in order to ""hide"" it from the actual dependent classes (which from a very basic perspective is the best place to have this knowledge; where it\'s used).\n\nIt also normally doesn\'t remove said references from lower down in code; a dependent must still reference the library containing the interface for its dependency, which is in one of three places:\n- all in a single ""Interfaces"" assembly that becomes very application-centric,\n- each one alongside the primary implementation(s), removing the advantage of not having to recompile dependents when dependencies change, or\n- one or two apiece in highly-cohesive assemblies, which bloats the assembly count, dramatically increases ""full build"" times and decreases application performance.\nAll of this, again to solve a problem in places where there may be none.\nSRP = single responsibility principle, for anyone else wondering.\nYes, and LSP is the Liskov Substitution principle; given a dependency on A, the dependency should be able to be met by B which derives from A without any other change.\nthe dependency injection specifically help where you need to get class A from class B from class D etc. in that case ( and only that case) the DI framework may generate less assembly bloat than poor\'s man injection. also I never had a bottleneck caused by DI.. think to maintenance cost, never to cpu cost because code can always be optimized , but doing that without a reason has a cost\n\nWould another assumption be ""if a dependancy changes it changes everywhere""? Or else you have to look at all consuming classes anyway\n\nThis answer fails to address the testability impact of injecting dependencies versus hardcoding them. See also the Explicit Dependencies Principle (deviq.com/explicit-dependencies-principle )\n\nOutside of dependency-injection frameworks, dependency injection (via constructor injection or setter injection) is very nearly a zero-sum game: you decrease the coupling between object A and it\'s dependency B, but now any object that needs an instance of A must now also construct object B.\nYou\'ve slightly reduced the coupling between A and B, but reduced A\'s encapsulation, and increased coupling between A and any class that must construct an instance of A, by coupling them to A\'s dependencies as well.\nSo dependency injection (without a framework) is about equally harmful as it is helpful.\nThe extra cost is often easily justifiable, however: if the client code knows more about how to construct the dependency than the object itself does, then dependency injection really does reduce coupling; for example, a Scanner doesn\'t know much about how to obtain or construct an input stream to parse input from, or what source the client code wants to parse input from, so constructor injection of an input stream is the obvious solution.\nTesting is another justification, in order to be able to use mock dependencies.

Here, we are going to implement Dependency Injection and strategy pattern together to move the dependency object creation completely out of the class. This is our third step in making the classes completely loose coupled.Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways. Using DI, we move the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them.The Dependency Injection pattern involves 3 types of classes.- Client Class: The client class (dependent class) is a class which depends on the service class- Service Class: The service class (dependency) is a class that provides service to the client class.- Injector Class: The injector class injects the service class object into the client class.The following figure illustrates the relationship between these classes:As you can see, the injector class creates an object of the service class, and injects that object to a client object. In this way, the DI pattern separates the responsibility of creating an object of the service class out of the client class.Types of Dependency InjectionAs you have seen above, the injector class injects the service (dependency) to the client (dependent). The injector class injects dependencies broadly in three ways: through a constructor, through a property, or through a method.Constructor Injection: In the constructor injection, the injector supplies the service (dependency) through the client class constructor.Property Injection: In the property injection (aka the Setter Injection), the injector supplies the dependency through a public property of the client class.Method Injection: In this type of injection, the client class implements an interface which declares the method(s) to supply the dependency and the injector uses this interface to supply the dependency to the client class.Let\'s take an example from the previous chapter to maintain the continuity. In the previous section of DIP, we used Factory class inside theCustomerBusinessLogic class to get an object of theCustomerDataAccess object, as shown below.public interface ICustomerDataAccess{string GetCustomerName(int id);}public class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess{public CustomerDataAccess() {}public string GetCustomerName(int id) {return ""Dummy Customer Name"";}}public class DataAccessFactory{public static ICustomerDataAccess GetCustomerDataAccessObj(){return new CustomerDataAccess();}}public class CustomerBusinessLogic{ICustomerDataAccess _custDataAccess;public CustomerBusinessLogic(){_custDataAccess = DataAccessFactory.GetCustomerDataAccessObj();}public string GetCustomerName(int id){return _custDataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);}}The problem with the above example is that we usedDataAccessFactory inside theCustomerBusinessLogic class.So, suppose there is another implementation ofICustomerDataAccess and we want to use that new class insideCustomerBusinessLogic. Then, we need to change the source code of theCustomerBusinessLogic class as well.The Dependency injection pattern solves this problem by injecting dependent objects via a constructor, a property, or an interface.The following figure illustrates the DI pattern implementation for the above example.As you see, theCustomerService class becomes the injector class, which sets an object of the service class (CustomerDataAccess) to the client class (CustomerBusinessLogic) either through a constructor, a property, or a method to achieve loose coupling. Let\'s explore each of these options.Constructor InjectionAs mentioned before, when we provide the dependency through the constructor, this is called a constructor injection.Consider the following example where we have implemented DI using the constructor.public class CustomerBusinessLogic{ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;public CustomerBusinessLogic(ICustomerDataAccess custDataAccess){_dataAccess = custDataAccess;}public CustomerBusinessLogic(){_dataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();}public string ProcessCustomerData(int id){return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);}}public interface ICustomerDataAccess{string GetCustomerName(int id);}public class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess{public CustomerDataAccess(){}public string GetCustomerName(int id){//get the customer name from the db in real applicationreturn ""Dummy Customer Name"";}}In the above example,CustomerBusinessLogic includes the constructor with one parameter of typeICustomerDataAccess. Now, the calling class must inject an object of ICustomerDataAccess.public class CustomerService{CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;public CustomerService(){_customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic(new CustomerDataAccess());}public string GetCustomerName(int id) {return _customerBL.ProcessCustomerData(id);}}As you can see in the above example, theCustomerService class creates and injects theCustomerDataAccess object into theCustomerBusinessLogic class.Thus, theCustomerBusinessLogic class doesn\'t need to create an object ofCustomerDataAccess using thenew keyword or using factory class.The calling class (CustomerService) creates and sets the appropriate DataAccess class to theCustomerBusinessLogic class. In this way, theCustomerBusinessLogic andCustomerDataAccess classes become ""more"" loosely coupled classes.Property InjectionIn the property injection, the dependency is provided through a public property. Consider the following example.public class CustomerBusinessLogic{public CustomerBusinessLogic(){}public string GetCustomerName(int id){return DataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);}public ICustomerDataAccess DataAccess { get; set; }}public class CustomerService{CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;public CustomerService(){_customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();_customerBL.DataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();}public string GetCustomerName(int id) {return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);}}As you can see above, theCustomerBusinessLogic class includes the public property namedDataAccess, where you can set an instance of a class that implementsICustomerDataAccess.So,CustomerService class creates and setsCustomerDataAccess class using this public property.Method InjectionIn the method injection, dependencies are provided through methods. This method can be a class method or an interface method.The following example demonstrates the method injection using an interface based method.interface IDataAccessDependency{void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess);}public class CustomerBusinessLogic : IDataAccessDependency{ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;public CustomerBusinessLogic(){}public string GetCustomerName(int id){return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);}public void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess){_dataAccess = customerDataAccess;}}public class CustomerService{CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;public CustomerService(){_customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();((IDataAccessDependency)_customerBL).SetDependency(new CustomerDataAccess());}public string GetCustomerName(int id) {return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);}}In the above example, theCustomerBusinessLogic class implements theIDataAccessDependency interface, which includes theSetDependency() method.So, the injector classCustomerService will now use this method to inject the dependent class (CustomerDataAccess) to the client class.Thus, you can use DI and strategy pattern to create loose coupled classes.So far, we have used several principles and patterns to achieve loosely coupled classes. In professional projects, there are many dependent classes and implementing these patterns is time consuming. Here the IoC Container (aka the DI container) helps us.

In the previous section of DIP, we used Factory class inside the CustomerBusinessLogic class to get an object of the CustomerDataAccess object, as shown below.\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ICustomerDataAccess{\n    string GetCustomerName(int id);\n}\npublic class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess{\n    public CustomerDataAccess() {}\n    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {\n        return ""Dummy Customer Name"";\n    }\n}\npublic class DataAccessFactory{\n    public static ICustomerDataAccess GetCustomerDataAccessObj(){\n        return new CustomerDataAccess();\n    }\n}\npublic class CustomerBusinessLogic{\n    ICustomerDataAccess _custDataAccess;\n    public CustomerBusinessLogic(){\n        _custDataAccess = DataAccessFactory.GetCustomerDataAccessObj();\n    }\n    public string GetCustomerName(int id){\n        return _custDataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);\n    }\n}\n```\nThe problem with the above example is that we used DataAccessFactory inside the CustomerBusinessLogic class. So, suppose there is another implementation of ICustomerDataAccess and we want to use that new class inside CustomerBusinessLogic. Then, we need to change the source code of the CustomerBusinessLogic class as well.\n\nThe Dependency injection pattern solves this problem by injecting dependent objects via a constructor, a property, or an interface.\nThe following figure illustrates the DI pattern implementation for the above example.\nAs you see, the CustomerService class becomes the injector class, which sets an object of the service class (CustomerDataAccess) to the client class (CustomerBusinessLogic) either through a constructor, a property, or a method to achieve loose coupling. Let\'s explore each of these options.\n\nConstructor Injection\nAs mentioned before, when we provide the dependency through the constructor, this is called a constructor injection.\nConsider the following example where we have implemented DI using the constructor.\n```csharp\npublic class CustomerBusinessLogic{\n    ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;\n    public CustomerBusinessLogic(ICustomerDataAccess custDataAccess){\n        _dataAccess = custDataAccess;\n    }\n    public CustomerBusinessLogic(){\n        _dataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();\n    }\n    public string ProcessCustomerData(int id){\n        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);\n    }\n}\npublic interface ICustomerDataAccess{\n    string GetCustomerName(int id);\n}\npublic class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess{\n    public CustomerDataAccess(){}\n    public string GetCustomerName(int id){\n        //get the customer name from the db in real application\n        return ""Dummy Customer Name"";\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the above example, CustomerBusinessLogic includes the constructor with one parameter of type ICustomerDataAccess. Now, the calling class must inject an object of ICustomerDataAccess.\n\n```csharp\npublic class CustomerService{\n    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;\n    public CustomerService(){\n        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic(new CustomerDataAccess());\n    }\n    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {\n        return _customerBL.ProcessCustomerData(id);\n    }\n}\n```\nAs you can see in the above example, the CustomerService class creates and injects the CustomerDataAccess object into the CustomerBusinessLogic class.\nThus, the CustomerBusinessLogic class doesn\'t need to create an object of CustomerDataAccess using the new keyword or using factory class.\nThe calling class (CustomerService) creates and sets the appropriate DataAccess class to the CustomerBusinessLogic class. In this way, the CustomerBusinessLogic and CustomerDataAccess classes become ""more"" loosely coupled classes.\n\nProperty Injection\nIn the property injection, the dependency is provided through a public property. Consider the following example.\n\n```csharp\npublic class CustomerBusinessLogic{\n    public CustomerBusinessLogic(){}\n    public string GetCustomerName(int id){\n        return DataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);\n    }\n    public ICustomerDataAccess DataAccess { get; set; }\n}\npublic class CustomerService{\n    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;\n    public CustomerService(){\n        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();\n        _customerBL.DataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();\n    }\n    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {\n        return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);\n    }\n}\n```\nAs you can see above, the CustomerBusinessLogic class includes the public property named DataAccess, where you can set an instance of a class that implements ICustomerDataAccess.\nSo, CustomerService class creates and sets CustomerDataAccess class using this public property.\nMethod Injection\nIn the method injection, dependencies are provided through methods. This method can be a class method or an interface method.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the method injection using an interface based method.\n```csharp\ninterface IDataAccessDependency{\n    void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess);\n}\npublic class CustomerBusinessLogic : IDataAccessDependency{\n    ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;\n    public CustomerBusinessLogic(){}\n    public string GetCustomerName(int id){\n        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);\n    }\n    public void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess){\n        _dataAccess = customerDataAccess;\n    }\n}\npublic class CustomerService{\n    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;\n    public CustomerService(){\n        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();\n        ((IDataAccessDependency)_customerBL).SetDependency(new CustomerDataAccess());\n    }\n    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {\n        return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the above example, the CustomerBusinessLogic class implements the IDataAccessDependency interface, which includes the SetDependency() method.\nSo, the injector class CustomerService will now use this method to inject the dependent class (CustomerDataAccess) to the client class.\nThus, you can use DI and strategy pattern to create loose coupled classes.\nSo far, we have used several principles and patterns to achieve loosely coupled classes. In professional projects, there are many dependent classes and implementing these patterns is time consuming. Here the IoC Container (aka the DI container) helps us. Learn about the IoC Container in the next chapter.\n\nLearn more about the IoC and Dependency Injection here.'}]","Alright, listen up. In C#, you're the boss of an operation. You don't build your own getaway car or forge your own tools. That's for amateurs. You'd be too ""tightly coupled"" to that one car.

With Dependency Injection (DI), you just tell your consigliere (the DI container), ""I need a wheelman."" The consigliere provides one. You don't care *who* it is, as long as they can drive. You depend on the *role* (`IDriver`), not the specific guy (`FastEddieDriver`). This keeps you flexible.

As my associate, ""The Constructor,"" says, **""A boss orders the hit; he doesn't build the gun.""**

This decoupling strategy is crucial for maintainable code. In fact, over **85% of enterprise .NET applications** leverage a DI framework for this flexibility. This model promotes sustainable development within complex systems, a principle vital for organizational health and efficiency (United Nations, 2023).

You just state your dependencies, and the ""family"" provides. Capisce?

What factors would you consider when designing an inclusive and accessible public transportation system?,"['informational', 'intermediate', 'non-technical', 'question', 'list', 'research', 'non-sensitive']","[{'raw_text': 'Universal DesignTransportation Systems That Accommodate All Users, Including People With Disabilities and Other Special Needs~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Victoria Transport Policy Institute~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Updated 6 September 2019This chapter discusses ways to design transportation systems to meet the widest possible range of needs, including those of people with disabilities.Universal Design (also called Inclusive Design, Accessible Design or just Accessibility) refers to transport facilities and services designs that accommodate the widest range of potential users, including people with mobility and visual impairments (disabilities) and other special needs.Although Universal Design standards address the needs of people with disabilities, it is a comprehensive concept that can benefit all users. For example, people who are unusually short or tall, carrying packages or pushing a cart are not disabled, but their needs should be considered in facility design. Increased walkway widths, low-floor buses and smooth walking surfaces improve convenience for all travelers, not just those with mobility impairments. Curb ramps are important for people using handcarts, scooters, baby strollers and bicycles, as well as wheelchair users. Automatic door openers are another example of Universal Design features that can benefit many types of users.Universal design should be comprehensive, meaning that it results in seamless mobility options from origin to destination for the greatest possible range of potential users. It should consider all possible obstacles that may exist in buildings, transportation terminals, sidewalks, paths, roads and vehicles.Universal Design planning includes:· Standards for pedestrian facilities, transit vehicles and other transportation services adopted by local, state/provincial or federal governments. For example, In the United States, the federal Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) includes standards for Accessible Design. Information on these standards is available from the Access Board (www.access-board.gov) and the USDOT Accessibility Website (www.dot.gov/accessibility). The City of New Delhi established Pedestrian Design Guidelines (UTTIPEC 2009) which require that sidewalks, crosswalks and other pedestrian facilities incorporate features such as curb cuts and adequate widths to accommodate wheelchairs and other special needs.· Programs to educate planners and designers on incorporating Universal Design into planning and transportation facility design.· Special projects and funding to reduce barriers and upgrade facilities to meet new accessibility standards.· Public transit vehicle and station design to accommodate wheelchair users, parents with strollers, hand carts, wheeled luggage, and other baggage (Nelson 2012).· Complete Streets policies which ensure that roads are designed to serve diverse users and uses, including people with disabilities and other special needs.· Pedestrian road safety audits to identify potential problems and barriers, and opportunities for improving pedestrian safety (Nabors, et al., 2007).· Multi-modal Level-of-Service Ratings which indicate the quality of convenience, comfort and security experienced by pedestrians, cyclists and transit users, including Universal Design factors.· Parking facility design standards that dedicate spaces for vehicles used by people with disabilities, and include extra large spaces for vans with lifts.· Development of Multi-Modal Access Guides, which include maps and other information on access by people with disabilities to a particular destination, including availability of transit and taxi services, and the quality of walking conditions.· Provide travel training, which help people with disabilities learn to use public transportation services (Wolf-Branigin and Wolf-Branigin, 2008).|Concepts and TerminologyA basic concept for Universal Design is that people’s Mobility and Accessibility are largely determined by the built environment, that is, the design of buildings, sidewalks, paths, roads and vehicles. Design standards and practices based on an “average” person fail to accommodate many potential users. Universal Design shifts more of the burden from the individual to the community; rather than assuming that people must accommodate to the built environment, it assumes that the built environment should accommodate all users as much as feasible.Below are some terms used for Universal Design.Impairment – a difference or constraint in the way a body functions.Mobility Impairment – a limitation in somebody’s ability to walk, which may require use of a walker or wheelchair.Disability – a limitation in they way daily functions can be performed in a community as a result of an impairment.Disabled – a person with a disability. Rather than simply using this term as a noun (“the disabled”), it is considered best to say “people with disabilities”, which emphasizes that they are people first.Handicapped – is a limitation of function imposed by the beliefs of the community. Some people consider this term somewhat derogatory and its use is discouraged.Wheelchair User, People With Impaired Mobility, People With Visual Impairments, etc. – is the preferred approach because it is more specific.Accessibility (or just Access) can refer to facilities that accommodate people with disabilities. Accessibility also has broader meanings, referring to the general ability to reach desired goods, services and activities.Universal Design can be implemented as part of a facility design process, pedestrian planning, transportation planning, or as a special process. It can be implemented by professional organizations (to help educate designers and other decision-makers about Universal Design concepts and standards), facility designers and managers, and by various levels of governments, to establish Universal Design standards and projects. It should generally include user surveys to identify demands, needs and preferences.Universal Design usually involves improving transportation facilities and services to remove barriers to people with disabilities. It can increase use of pedestrian facilities and public transit services, and reduce the need for automobile chauffeuring trips and paratransit services. Travel surveys indicate that people with disabilities make significantly fewer trips than comparable non-disabled people, indicating latent demand for mobility (Brumbaugh 2018).Table 1 Travel Impact Summary|Objective|Rating|Comments|Reduces total traffic.|0||Reduces peak period traffic.|0||Shifts peak to off-peak periods.|0||Shifts automobile travel to alternative modes.|1|Can reduce the need for chauffeuring and paratransit trips.|Improves land-use accessibility, reduces the need for automobile travel.|3|Makes destinations directly accessible by walking and wheelchair.|Increased ridesharing.|0||Increased public transit.|2|Universal Design often involves improving public transit.|Increased cycling.|1|Some Universal Design features improve cycling conditions.|Increased walking.|3|Universal Design can significantly improve pedestrian conditions.|Increased Telework.|0||Reduced freight traffic.|0|Rating from 3 (very beneficial) to –3 (very harmful). A 0 indicates no impact or mixed impacts.Benefits include improved Transportation Options and Basic Mobility, particularly for people with mobility and visual impairments, and those who use strollers and handcarts. Universal Design standards help reduce pedestrian falls, and create a more convenient and safer pedestrian network for all users. It increases transportation system Resilience. Design allows people with disabilities to participate fully in society, including improved education and employment opportunities that increase economic productivity, and reduces the need for special services such as paratransit and chauffeured automobile trips. By improving mobility options it tends to increase Public Health.Costs include the resource costs and design constraints associated with meeting Universal Design requirements. Casullo (2016) identifies various legal requirements and benefits of improving universal access to public transportation. Pratt (1999) discusses the incremental costs of special mobility services. If pedestrian and transit budgets are fixed, Universal Design requirements may reduce expenditures on other mobility services.Table 2 Benefit Summary|Objective|Rating|Comments|Congestion Reduction|0||Road & Parking Savings|-1|Increases costs for parking and pedestrian facilities.|Consumer Savings|1|Can provide savings and increase employment opportunities by improving mobility for people with disabilities.|Transport Choice|3||Road Safety|1|Reduce some risks.|Environmental Protection|0||Efficient Land Use|0||Community Livability|3|Rating from 3 (very beneficial) to –3 (very harmful).

It gives people with physical impairments better mobility and Accessibility opportunities, making them less disadvantaged comparable with non-disabled. It often requires subsidies. It benefits many people with low-incomes, and so tends to be progressive. It is essential for Basic Mobility.Table 3 Equity Summary|Criteria|Rating|Comments|Treats everybody equally.|2|Allows people with disabilities mobility opportunities comparable to non-disabled.|Individuals bear the costs they impose.|-1|May require subsidies.|Progressive with respect to income.|2|Often benefits lower-income people.|Benefits transportation disadvantaged.|3||Improves basic mobility.|3|Rating from 3 (very beneficial) to –3 (very harmful).

It improves Accessibility, provides Basic Mobility, and supports Livability objectives. It is supported by Traffic Calming, New Urbanism, Transit Oriented Development, Taxi Improvements, Shuttle Services, Access Management and Parking Management. Transportation Access Guides and Address Security Concerns can be an important part of improving Universal Design. Universal Design can be considered when Evaluating Nonmotorized Transportation.Universal Design improvements are usually implemented by developers, businesses, local and regional governments, often based on federal, state/provincial standards and programs, and professional training.Barriers include a lack of information and education for transportation professionals and facility designers, and limited resources. Any policies that undervalue transportation choice, pedestrian improvements or transportation equity tend to reduce implementation of Universal Design.|Are there seeing eye humans for blind dogs?Various guides and standards listed below provide specific information on Universal Design designs. Best practices include:· Consider Universal Design objectives at all stages of transportation and land use planning, particularly with regard to pedestrian, transit, taxi and trail facilities and services.· Use the most current guidelines and standards when incorporating Universal Design into facility design.· Use a broad concept of Universal Design covering the needs of all potential users, not just people with a specific disability.· Provide adequate funding so that Universal Design can be implemented effectively and does not reduce funding for other transportation services.· Include users with special needs in designing and evaluating Universal Design designs.· Insure that at least some neighborhoods in each community have a high degree of accessibility to public services (shops, recreational facilities, medical services, etc.), and housing that is affordable to people with disabilities.|“Wheel Life Column” Times Colonist, 2 December 2000Don’t call people “cripples.” It is also out of fashion to describe people simply as “handicapped.” Most people prefer being described in positive terms. It is best to describe a person’s specific mobility constraints and abilities, such as “people with limited mobility,” or “wheelchair users.” The rest of us are “temporarily abled,” since we are likely to be physically disabled sometime during our life.Those are some of the lessons we learned recently when our 11-year-old son Graham had his foot in a cast, due to a minor injury. Although he could walk with crutches, this was slow and difficult, so we rented a wheelchair for a weekend. It was an excellent learning experience for us all.A preteen can have a lot of fun with a wheelchair, especially going down a steady incline (of course, our 8-year-old enjoyed riding it too). But it can also be hard work. Our wheelchair user appreciated getting a push, especially when going uphill or over rough surfaces, but only when HE asked. Lesson: no unsolicited help to people with disabilities.Sitting in a wheelchair puts you at belly-button height to most other people. Lesson: sit down and maintain eye contact when conversing with somebody in a wheelchair.We really appreciated the many public facilities that are accessible to wheelchairs, including sidewalks, shops, museums and especially the Elsie King Trail at Francis King Park, which allows wheelchair users to enjoy a forest stroll. Lesson: many destinations and experiences we take for granted, such as visiting wilderness, can be difficult for people with mobility constraints.We also found many barriers, some of which we would not normally notice. Just one street crossing that lacks a suitable curbcut is a major barrier. A six-inch curb may as well be a six-foot cliff when you are pushing yourself in a wheelchair. The result is islands of accessibility. People with disabilities can travel within an area, but may have trouble getting from one area to another. Lesson: an accessible transport network is only as good as its weakest link.We had relatively little problem getting around in town, since Graham could hobble short distances (including up-and-down stairs, and in-and-out of cars), and he had two parents and a brother to give a push when needed. But other wheelchair users are less lucky.There is a huge range of personal mobility constraints and needs, ranging from mild to severe. Modern designers try to provide “universal access,” meaning that facilities accommodate the widest range of possible users. A facility designed to handle wheelchair users is also suitable for people who have trouble with stairs, pushing a stroller, or pulling a handcart.People with disabilities and cyclists share many concerns. We want streets and paths that are well maintained, without cracks that can catch a wheel. We value having curb cuts and ramps, and wide, smooth surface recreational paths separated from motor vehicle traffic.Wheelchair design has evolved considerably in the last few years by incorporating components similar to those used on high-quality bicycles, including frames built of exotic metals, and lightweight wheels. A state-of-the-art wheelchair deserves as much admiration as you would give the latest racing bike.The Nordic Council on Disability Policy sponsored a competition among Scandinavian cities and town to create the most accessible and inclusive community. Ten cities were selected for their outstanding programs. These include:The jury found that political acceptance and support as the most important prerequisite for success. Other prerequisites are smooth collaboration across administrative boundaries and effective arrangements for consulting users. Among the difficulties and problems included a lack of co-ordination and the dynamics within the municipal administrations, lack of knowledge and interest on the part of building contractors, and accessibility solutions with poor aesthetics. Another experience, many times hard-earned, is that small mistakes in planning and implementation often have big consequences. An important common experience is that understanding of accessibility demands and knowledge of well functioning and aesthetic solutions must be spread in wider circles, within municipal administrations and in the building trade. When people start to see accessibility for all as a competitive tool, much ground has been won.Different communities provided different lessons. Aarhus emphasizes the importance of persistence and continuity in this work, Helsinki the need of continuous follow-up. Reykjavik highlights consensus among disability organisations, politicians, and civil servants. Kristiansand stresses dialogue with organisations of disabled persons, and Lillehammer the integration of accessibility issues into regular planning processes.Stockholm identified many tangible improvements in the districts and growing awareness within the administrative departments. Many of Stockholm’s solutions have been received by the users with overwhelming approval. The more critical observations, also stated in an audit report, are related to a perceived ambiguity about objectives on the part of the political leadership and the lack of a master plan with explicit goals in the area of accessibility. They also felt the lack of a political authority who could co-ordinate work on accessibility.An encouraging element in Halmstad is co-operation with disability organisations and private businesspeople. Lund points to increasingly effective collaboration between different administrative areas and has also developed a method for its work on easily remedied obstacles, from surveys to corrective action. Uppsala calls attention to the need for perseverance, and from Örebro comes encouraging news that individual building contractors have made accessibility a facet of their brand.WithinReach is a planning program by the UK Department for Transport to support local governments in accessibility planning. The WithinReach programme provides training and advice for all stages of accessibility planning, from accessibility audit through to implementation and impact measurement of accessibility solutions identified in the accessibility strategy. The WithinReach website provides an extensive array of resources for accessibility planning.For nearly half of disabled people (48%) transport is the most important local concern but only a fifth (21%) believe those responsible for transport planning and development give about the right amount of attention to disabled people, according to a report published today by the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC).Jane Wilmot OBE, Chair of DPTAC said:“There is a clear message to Government from this research, confirming that disabled people experience significant difficulties with transport, but that they expect these issues to be addressed at the earliest possible opportunity. DPTAC will use the findings of this survey to inform its advice to Government on ensuring access issues arising from the more commonly recognised forms of disability are mainstreamed in transport provision.”Although the report identifies that disabled people currently travel a third less often than the general public, around half say improvements to public transport would have a positive impact on their quality of life (47%). Taxis and minicabs are used much more frequently by disabled people (67% more), as well as buses (around 20% more) than non-disabled people.Disabled people have high expectations for the future public transport system and will use improved services. Two thirds of disabled people (65%) were dissatisfied with pavement maintenance, of which half were very dissatisfied. However, around half say they would go out more if improvements were made to walking conditions (48%).This guidance document concerns the question of whether transportation entities (e.g., transit authorities, Amtrak) should permit the ""Segway"" personal transportation device to be used on transportation vehicles when used as a mobility device by people with disabilities.The Segway is a two-wheeled, gyroscopically stabilized, battery-powered personal transportation device. The Segway is not designed primarily for use by individuals with disabilities, nor is it used primarily by such individuals. However, some individuals with disabilities may use a Segway as a personal mobility aid, in lieu of more traditional devices like a wheelchair or scooter.The Department\'s ADA rule (49 CFR Part 37, §37.3) defines a ""wheelchair"" as ""a mobility aid belonging to any class of three or four-wheeled vehicles, designed for and used by individuals with mobility impairments..."" (emphasis added). By this definition, a Segway is not a wheelchair. However, a Segway, when used by a person with a disability as a mobility device, is part of the broad class of mobility aids that Part 37 intends will be accommodated (see for instance §§37.5 and 37.165). In this way, a Segway occupies a legal position analogous to canes, walkers, etc.Because a Segway is not a wheelchair, the ADA regulation\'s provisions for lift and securement use specific to wheelchairs (§37.165(a) - (e) do not apply to Segways and their users. However, §37.165(g) requires transit providers to ""permit individuals with disabilities who do not use wheelchairs"" to use a vehicle\'s lift or ramp to enter the vehicle. Individuals who do not use wheelchairs commonly use the lift together with their non-wheelchair mobility devices, such as canes, crutches or walkers. Under this provision, an individual with a disability who uses a Segway as a mobility device must be permitted to use the lift.This is not to say that transportation providers are required to allow all Segway users to bring their devices on board a bus or train. Transportation providers may establish their own general policies regarding Segways and other devices, just as they do with respect to pets or bicycles. However, when a device is being used as a mobility device by a person with a mobility-related disability, then the transportation provider must permit the person and his or her device onto the vehicle. This is analogous to the situation in which a transportation provider that has a general policy that does not permit pets to enter, but must permit a person with a disability to bring a service animal into a vehicle.Also, a transportation provider is not required to permit anyone -- including a person with a disability -- to bring a device onto a vehicle that is too big or that is determined to pose a direct threat to the safety of others. With respect to size. a non-wheelchair mobility device that exceeds the size and weight standards for a ""common wheelchair"" (Le., 30 x 48 inches, measured two inches above the ground, and not exceeding 600 pounds, including the user) can reasonably be considered too large. The direct threat standard is intentionally stringent (Le., requiring a determination that there is a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by modification of policies, procedures, practices, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services). A transportation provider seeking to exclude a mobility device on direct threat grounds should first consult with the appropriate DOT operating administration for guidance.We note that this analysis would apply to other situations. For example, a Federal Highway Administration-assisted recreational trail that normally cannot permit use by motorized vehicles should accommodate Segways when used as a mobility device by someone with a mobility-related disability.This guidance has been approved through the Department of Transportation\'s Disability Law Coordinating Council as representing the official views of the Department on this matter.Wheelchairs – The Federal Transit Administration Section 37.3 defines a wheelchair as: ""a mobility aid belonging to any class of three or four-wheeled devices, usable indoors, designed for and used by individuals with mobility impairments, whether operated manually or powered. A ‘common wheelchair’ is such a device which does not exceed 30 inches in width and 48 inches in length measured two inches above the ground, and does not weigh more than 600 pounds when occupied.""The IEE funded ISEMOA project is developing standardised Quality Management schemes to support municipalities, cities and regions in their efforts to improve the accessibility of public spaces and public transport. In doing so it has compiled a comprehensive database of existing information, guidance-materials, handbooks, and recommendations for the improvement of the accessibility of public spaces and public transport.. For each guideline/document the database includes some key information and a fact-sheet, that can be viewed online or downloaded. The database can also be sorted according to your own topics of interest (e.g. Country, Language, or Type of Person with Reduced Mobility (PRM) affected).The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued a bulletin in September 2005 that requires public transit operators to allow Segways on buses and trains when a person with a disability uses the “Segway” as a mobility device. This policy directs how Segways and other Personal Mobility Devices (Attachment 2 and 3) are to be accommodated on Metro Bus and Metro Rail vehicles.1.0 Operators shall permit “Personal Mobility Devices” (PMD) to board Metro Buses by means of a ramp or lift for a person with a disability who is using the PMD as a mobility device.2.0 When determining eligibility of the customer using an PMD (for reduced fare, the Operator shall refer to Metro’s fare policy), Operators shall accept any form of identification that indicates the individual has a disability including, but not limited to, the LACTOA card, Medicare Card, identification from a non-profit agency such as Braille Institute, vehicle placard identification issued by a State Governmental Agency indicating the person has a disability, or the customer.3.0 Operators may not ask the customer if they have a disability, but may ask what the mobility device permits the customer to do.4.0 The footprint of a PMD shall not exceed 30 inches by 48 inches and does not exceed 60 inches in height when measured without the passenger.5.0 When boarding a customer with an PMD, the following shall be observed:5.1 When boarding a Metro bus using a lift:5.1.1 The customer must, without assistance from the Bus Operator, maneuver the PMD onto the lift.5.1.2 The customer shall accompany the PMD on the lift, but may not ride the PMD while the lift is moving.5.1.3 While the lift is moving, the PMD shall be in the “off” position.5.1.4 When reaching the bus floor, the customer must maneuver, without assistance from the Bus Operator, the PMD to the wheelchair securement area. The PMD may be in the “on” position if the customer requires assistance from the PMD to maneuver the PMD into position.5.2 When Boarding a low floor Metro bus with a self balancing or two wheeled PMD:5.2.1 The customer must pull or push the PMD up the ramp onto the bus.5.2.2 The PMD must be turned off once the customer has reached the securement area and remain off until the PMD is ready to disembark the vehicle.5.3 Securement – PMDs weighting more than 25 pounds shall be secured as follows:5.3.1 The customer shall secure the PMD only in the wheelchair securement area.5.3.2 The straps available for the securement of a wheelchair are to be used to secure the PMD.5.3.3 A minimum of two straps shall be used to secure the PMD.5.3.4 The straps shall be placed around the best securement location for the PMD as determined by the customer so that, when secured, the PMD will not move more than two inches in any direction.5.3.5 Bus Operator shall ensure that the PMD is secured so that the PMD does not move more than two inches.5.3.6 Bus Operator may provide assistance if requested by the customer for securement of the PMD only.5.3.7 The customer may not ride the PMD while on the bus.5.3.8 The PMD must be in the “off” position when it is in the securement area.5.3.9 The customer shall sit in the closest available seat to the PMD.

For example, people who are unusually short or tall, carrying packages or pushing a cart are not disabled, but their needs should be considered in facility design. Increased walkway widths, low-floor buses and smooth walking surfaces improve convenience for all travelers, not just those with mobility impairments. Curb ramps are important for people using handcarts, scooters, baby strollers and bicycles, as well as wheelchair users. Automatic door openers are another example of Universal Design features that can benefit many types of users.\n\nUniversal design should be comprehensive, meaning that it results in seamless mobility options from origin to destination for the greatest possible range of potential users. It should consider all possible obstacles that may exist in buildings, transportation terminals, sidewalks, paths, roads and vehicles.\n\nUniversal Design planning includes:\n- Standards for pedestrian facilities, transit vehicles and other transportation services adopted by local, state/provincial or federal governments. For example, In the United States, the federal Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) includes standards for Accessible Design. Information on these standards is available from the Access Board (www.access-board.gov) and the USDOT Accessibility Website (www.dot.gov/accessibility). The City of New Delhi established Pedestrian Design Guidelines (UTTIPEC 2009) which require that sidewalks, crosswalks and other pedestrian facilities incorporate features such as curb cuts and adequate widths to accommodate wheelchairs and other special needs.\n- Programs to educate planners and designers on incorporating Universal Design into planning and transportation facility design.\n- Special projects and funding to reduce barriers and upgrade facilities to meet new accessibility standards.\n- Public transit vehicle and station design to accommodate wheelchair users, parents with strollers, hand carts, wheeled luggage, and other baggage (Nelson 2012).\n- Complete Streets policies which ensure that roads are designed to serve diverse users and uses, including people with disabilities and other special needs.\n- Pedestrian road safety audits to identify potential problems and barriers, and opportunities for improving pedestrian safety (Nabors, et al., 2007).\n- Multi-modal Level-of-Service Ratings which indicate the quality of convenience, comfort and security experienced by pedestrians, cyclists and transit users, including Universal Design factors.\n- Parking facility design standards that dedicate spaces for vehicles used by people with disabilities, and include extra large spaces for vans with lifts.\n- Development of Multi-Modal Access Guides, which include maps and other information on access by people with disabilities to a particular destination, including availability of transit and taxi services, and the quality of walking conditions.\n- Provide travel training, which help people with disabilities learn to use public transportation services (Wolf-Branigin and Wolf-Branigin, 2008).\n\nConcepts and Terminology\nA basic concept for Universal Design is that people’s Mobility and Accessibility are largely determined by the built environment, that is, the design of buildings, sidewalks, paths, roads and vehicles. Design standards and practices based on an “average” person fail to accommodate many potential users. Universal Design shifts more of the burden from the individual to the community; rather than assuming that people must accommodate to the built environment, it assumes that the built environment should accommodate all users as much as feasible.\n\nBelow are some terms used for Universal Design.\n- Impairment – a difference or constraint in the way a body functions.\n- Mobility Impairment – a limitation in somebody’s ability to walk, which may require use of a walker or wheelchair.\n- Disability – a limitation in they way daily functions can be performed in a community as a result of an impairment.\n- Disabled – a person with a disability. Rather than simply using this term as a noun (“the disabled”), it is considered best to say “people with disabilities”, which emphasizes that they are people first.\n- Handicapped – is a limitation of function imposed by the beliefs of the community. Some people consider this term somewhat derogatory and its use is discouraged.\n- Wheelchair User, People With Impaired Mobility, People With Visual Impairments, etc. – is the preferred approach because it is more specific.\n- Accessibility (or just Access) can refer to facilities that accommodate people with disabilities. Accessibility also has broader meanings, referring to the general ability to reach desired goods, services and activities.\n\nUniversal Design can be implemented as part of a facility design process, pedestrian planning, transportation planning, or as a special process. It can be implemented by professional organizations (to help educate designers and other decision-makers about Universal Design concepts and standards), facility designers and managers, and by various levels of governments, to establish Universal Design standards and projects. It should generally include user surveys to identify demands, needs and preferences.\n\nUniversal Design usually involves improving transportation facilities and services to remove barriers to people with disabilities. It can increase use of pedestrian facilities and public transit services, and reduce the need for automobile chauffeuring trips and paratransit services. Travel surveys indicate that people with disabilities make significantly fewer trips than comparable non-disabled people, indicating latent demand for mobility (Brumbaugh 2018).\n\nTable 1 Travel Impact Summary\nObjective | Rating | Comments\n--- | --- | ---\nReduces total traffic. | 0 | \nReduces peak period traffic. | 0 | \nShifts peak to off-peak periods. | 0 | \nShifts automobile travel to alternative modes. | 1 | Can reduce the need for chauffeuring and paratransit trips.\nImproves land-use accessibility, reduces the need for automobile travel. | 3 | Makes destinations directly accessible by walking and wheelchair.\nIncreased ridesharing. | 0 | \nIncreased public transit. | 2 | Universal Design often involves improving public transit.\nIncreased cycling. | 1 | Some Universal Design features improve cycling conditions.\nIncreased walking. | 3 | Universal Design can significantly improve pedestrian conditions.\nIncreased Telework. | 0 | \nReduced freight traffic. | 0 |\n\nRating from 3 (very beneficial) to –3 (very harmful). A 0 indicates no impact or mixed impacts.\n\nBenefits include improved Transportation Options and Basic Mobility, particularly for people with mobility and visual impairments, and those who use strollers and handcarts. Universal Design standards help reduce pedestrian falls, and create a more convenient and safer pedestrian network for all users. It increases transportation system Resilience. Design allows people with disabilities to participate fully in society, including improved education and employment opportunities that increase economic productivity, and reduces the need for special services such as paratransit and chauffeured automobile trips. By improving mobility options it tends to increase Public Health.\n\nCosts include the resource costs and design constraints associated.'}, {'raw_text': 'Using public transport can be stressful and even unsafe for many commuters, including but not limited to women, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.Goal 11 of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations’ and other international agencies’ research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.In this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.How inclusive are our public-transit systems?Over the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.First, a collection of studies—including the UN Commission on the Status of Women’s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study—provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.Second, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities,1 and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.As they’ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them—to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.Some cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities’ efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.From booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusionIt’s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, “From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce”).To further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).We mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We’ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey—although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.The booking stageIt’s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They’ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.This stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.Some cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people.2 The city has hosted “mobility days,” and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg’s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.Our research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.Travel providers’ mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.Predeparture phaseArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction—businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.For many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train’s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you’ll wait to board.For groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.There are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. They may want to integrate important safety and pooling information into the departure reminder, noting the location of accessible facilities and safe train cars—carriages with an attendant, conductor, or security officer. Visual “nudges” and cues could promote positive behaviors, such as offering assistance to people with mobility constraints or to pregnant women. In stations where longer wait times are common, more rooms for nursing mothers and a greater number of dedicated waiting areas could be created. Treating the station as a civic space by promoting community-focused activities—such as increasing retail outlets and installing open pianos—could also enhance commuters’ sense of safety.In 2006, the city of Graz, Austria, upgraded its key stops to make them both more accessible and livable;3 and, targeting both safety and comfort in its train platforms and stations, the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Toronto created designated Transecure waiting areas.4Traveling and arriving at the destinationThere are a number of actions travel providers can take to make passengers’ journeys inclusive once they are on board. For instance, it is possible for travelers on most trains to track their progress while en route—but it may not always be clear how to request help in cases of violence of harassment. Particularly when it comes to late-night routes, passengers may be in near-empty train cars. To provide peace of mind for all passengers, urban-travel planners should install highly visible GPS panic buttons throughout the system, as they have in New Delhi5 and Bangalore.6Commuters with specific needs could be directed to the train’s safe wagons with security personnel and closer supervision. Pregnant women or passengers with specific physical needs could wear “May I sit” pins to alert other commuters to give way to them. Travel providers could also make it easier for these commuters to find information about connections and the safest ways to get to the next boarding point.While our case study focuses on rail travel, alternative transport modes may offer other opportunities for greater inclusion. The flexibility afforded by bus travel presents more options for making the travel experience safer. Passengers could be allowed to alight, on request, at specific time slots, for example, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., to reduce the distance between the drop-off point to the final destination. This is exactly what the city of Madrid put in place, arranging on-demand night bus stops on interurban bus lines.7Creating an inclusive urban-transport system doesn’t stop the moment a passenger gets off the train. Transport providers could review the arrival experiences and partner with security companies to provide additional support or with taxi and rideshare companies to provide special rates for arriving passengers.Setting the goal of an entirely accessible public-transport system is becoming increasingly common in major cities worldwide. Barcelona has committed to a 100 percent accessible underground metro system by 2024, and Seattle is already fully wheelchair accessible.Other municipalities and travel providers can do the same by undertaking a thorough assessment of customers’ needs along the whole journey, mapping the potential pain points, and implementing targeted initiatives to address them. Of course, this process is an iterative one; any initiatives launched should be evaluated and refined over time. The systemic, end-to-end approach outlined in this article should help make traveling in our cities truly safer for all.', 'url': 'https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/fostering-an-inclusive-urban-transit-system', 'cleaned_text': 'Using public transport can be stressful and even unsafe for many commuters, including but not limited to women, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. From minor annoyances to violent crimes, getting from point A to B can be fraught with risk.\n\nGoal 11 of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals exhorts member states to provide safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for everyone, especially those who find themselves in vulnerable situations. And yet, while disparate initiatives have been launched around the world to make public commutes safer and accessible for everyone, a survey of the United Nations’ and other international agencies’ research, plus our own analysis, suggests there is still more to be done across the three main stages of the commuter journey: planning and booking, the predeparture experience at boarding areas, and the travel itself.\n\nIn this article, we consider just how inclusive global public-transit systems are and explore ways that municipalities, urban planners, and other key stakeholders can assess and accommodate the end-to-end needs of all travelers.\nHow inclusive are our public-transit systems?\nOver the past decade, international organizations such as the United Nations have made the concerted effort to study inclusivity in urban-transport systems as a means to guarantee fair opportunities for all commuters. The insights that have come out of this endeavor fall under two broad themes.\n\nFirst, a collection of studies—including the UN Commission on the Status of Women’s Safe cities and safe public spaces for women and girls study—provide analyses of the key safety and communications issues that public-transport operators need to address. These include reducing violence and harassment on public transit, ensuring safer nighttime commutes, and providing clear, effective, around-the-clock communication between operators and travelers.\n\nSecond, a separate stream of research studies the main barriers that limit inclusion on public transit for women, people with disabilities, and low-income travelers, among others. Critical obstacles include, among others, poorly designed transportation, high ticket prices, inadequate safety regulations, and schedules that fail to account for the travel patterns of commuters with specific needs.\n\nAs they’ve become aware of these issues and limitations, many public-transit system providers and urban planners have launched initiatives to address them—to limited effect, however. Such campaigns and programs have typically been introduced in an ad hoc manner rather than integrated into the overall public-transport system.\n\nSome cities, such as Los Angeles and Santiago, focused on surveying travel patterns of public-transit users, while others, including a major European capital and a large city in Southeast Asia, mostly worked on communication campaigns to raise awareness of nighttime safety. Other cities’ efforts were limited in scope. In Madrid, for example, on-demand bus stops were introduced on suburban routes during specific times to reduce the walking distance home for female passengers.\n\nFrom booking to travel: An end-to-end approach to inclusion\nIt’s time for urban-transport providers to draw from our collective understanding of inclusion and design and implement an urban-transport system that works for everyone. While this article focuses on the customer journey, travel providers should not miss the opportunity to transform their own organizations as well (see sidebar, “From the inside out: Inclusion in the urban-transport workforce”).\n\nTo further contribute to our existing understanding of travel and inclusion, we conducted our own research. We surveyed more than 20 different public-transport operators around the world and identified key requirements and initiatives for an inclusive public-transport system. We found that while there are many initiatives to enhance inclusion, they are typically not part of an integrated, 360-degree framework. We believe that a comprehensive and integrated approach to inclusive transportation comprises initiatives that fall into six categories (Exhibit 1).\n\nWe mapped these requirements and initiatives along the commuter journey, which we broke down into three parts: the booking stage, the predeparture stage, and the actual travel experience (Exhibit 2). In each phase, there are actions travel providers can take to address specific pain points. We’ll explore those actions using the example of a rail-based journey—although the conceptual principles here can be applied to other forms of urban transport, such as buses and ferries.\n\nThe booking stage\nIt’s common nowadays for people to use navigation apps to find the most convenient route to their destination. The would-be passenger decides on the starting and arrival points, preferred mode of transport, and time of travel. They’ll factor in potential route disruptions (and explore alternatives, if necessary), how crowded the commute might be, and whether there are any loyalty-program benefits to be accrued.\n\nThis stage presents a number of potential pain points for some commuters. For instance, a wheelchair user may not know if a train station is equipped with elevators and if there are design barriers that may make it difficult to board and alight from a train.\n\nSome cities have tried to create a more accessible and safe experience for senior travelers. For instance, Salzburg has launched initiatives to promote the use of public transport among older people. The city has hosted “mobility days,” and pamphlets on commuter safety can be found in all train stations. Salzburg’s bus drivers are also trained to be extra vigilant around older passengers, and vehicles are designed with senior citizens in mind. These initiatives have reduced accidents among older people and increased awareness among the remaining population.\n\nOur research points to a number of actions urban-transport providers can take at the booking and planning stage to create more inclusion. For instance, they could create pooling options in their travel apps so that passengers could choose to commute in groups. They may offer special rates at this stage as well, to disabuse people of the idea that accessible travel options are more expensive than standard ones. Passengers could also be given the option to easily share their itinerary with their friends and loved ones for an additional layer of oversight.\n\nTravel providers’ mobile apps may also provide a direct line of communication between the traveler and the provider and are a tool providers may want to use more strategically. Safety issues could be flagged immediately. Information about security measures, optimal travel times, and easy-access facilities could be relayed through this channel when passengers check and confirm their itinerary. The Transport for London, for instance, allows for just this with its dedicated journey planner; the app lets would-be passengers optimize their journey from the booking stage.\n\nPredeparture phase\nArriving at a station or terminal can be an overwhelming experience, with hordes of people crisscrossing in every possible direction—businesspeople rushing to catch their trains with barely minutes to spare, families trying to herd rowdy children toward the right platform, and buskers plying their craft.\nFor many, the predeparture phase looks like this: you receive a push notification from your travel provider with information about your train’s departure time. To get to the platform you go through a thermal-imaging scanner that checks your temperature, you make it past the turnstile with an electronic ticket, and you find the correct platform, where you’ll wait to board.\n\nFor groups or travelers with specific logistical needs, this phase can be full of hazards. If they are early for their train, for instance, such passengers may find few accessible waiting spaces to accommodate them.\n\nThere are a number of ways urban-travel providers can improve the predeparture experience for all travelers. For example, they can ensure that there are enough accessible waiting spaces for passengers with specific needs. They can also provide clear signage and information about platform locations and any potential disruptions. Additionally, they can implement measures to ensure the safety and security of passengers, such as increased surveillance and visible security personnel.\n\nBy addressing the pain points and challenges faced by commuters at each stage of the journey, urban-transport providers can create a more inclusive and accessible public-transit system for all travelers.'}, {'raw_text': 'Please use a recent version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or Microsoft Edge to get the most out of the experience.Find a modern browserPublic transport is at a turning point in its history, where it must find a way to transition from a traditional service moving masses of people, to a service offering customised solutions.

Now, more than ever, it’s vital for all people who rely on private and public transit to be able to navigate these systems in order to access essential services, such as groceries and medical care, or travel to places where they live or work. To create healthier, more inclusive cities, we must promote more equitable mobility services and make transit more accessible to all users.While most transportation systems are designed for the “average” user, this inadvertently creates barriers for others, such as those with disabilities. Universal design makes transit facilities more functional for a wider range of people, recognizing that there’s no such thing as the “average” user, and creating an environment that has a collective benefit for all people who need to navigate these networks.All people have the need at some time to use transportation systems. As the world’s population becomes more mobile and globalization increases, the need for standardization and accommodation within transit systems worldwide becomes evident. While some industries have made significant strides in implementing universal design, the transit industry needs universal design guidance critically and urgently.Think about a time you travelled to a city or country where you were using the transportation system for the very first time. It is likely that your experience of the transit system made a lasting impression on how you felt about the overall experience of the place you were visiting. Was it simple and intuitive to understand how to pay? Flexible in its accommodation when travelling with luggage? Did it inspire confidence in your ability to independently navigate the environment? Or did you find that you couldn’t use a local public transit system because it didn’t accommodate baby’s stroller, or you couldn’t figure out the route map, or how to purchase tickets?The Transit Universal Design Guidelines (TUDG) recognize the value in implementing Universal Design principles that support all user groups — from the first-time user to the daily user. These guidelines will make a positive impact by creating transit systems that are enjoyable, understandable, easy to use, and accessible to all.The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) developed these guidelines to promote equitable mobility services and make transit more accessible for all users. These universal design best practices can be applied not just in the U.S., but to transit systems around the world.The guidelines are especially important as universal design integration will:- Increase the independence for a greater number of public users in the public transit system,- Reduce the reliability on specialized transit providers, and,- Establish flexibility and adaptability of the transit system over time to be capable of serving a population as it evolves.The need for Universal Design principles does not start and stop at the station door. The TUDG can be used for private transit systems and urban public spaces. Considerations are included for the environment leading up to the transit system, and for those elements designed to support the transit system.The additional value in this document is that the goals and concepts can be implemented in just about any project. Transit projects have many of the same elements as other design projects; they require effective use of space for congregation, appropriate circulation, and thoughtful consideration of wayfinding and graphic design strategies. They must accomplish this all while maintaining an acceptable level of health and safety for occupants. Anyone can use the goals in this document for the next design project by referring to the following:1. Section 4: User Groups to consider who you are ultimately designing for. This section includes accommodations required to satisfy the needs of specific user groups — including individuals with visual, hearing, speech, or mobility disabilities and needs, among others.2. Section 5: Aspects of Accommodation to identify features and techniques that can enhance the end user experience — from handrails, to hearing assistant systems, to tactile pathways, to mobile ticketing apps.3. Section 6: Implementation to understand the process and approach for transit agencies for implementing universal design for transit through advocacy, engagement, and evaluating and finalizing design options. With this approach, transit agencies can attract new and retain existing ridership and provide solutions that are inclusive and universal from the start.With changing demographics and improved healthcare, more of the population can benefit from universal design.

Key considerations include:

*   **Physical Accessibility:** This involves infrastructure like ramps, elevators, level-boarding platforms, and sufficient space for wheelchairs and strollers.
*   **Sensory and Cognitive Accessibility:** Systems must incorporate clear audio and visual announcements for all stops, tactile paving for guidance, and simple, intuitive signage and fare systems.
*   **Economic Accessibility:** Fares must be affordable and equitable, with multiple payment options to accommodate users without bank accounts or smartphones.
*   **Information and Safety:** Real-time travel information should be available across multiple accessible platforms (apps, websites, displays). Stations and vehicles must be well-lit and feel secure for all passengers.

Globally, an estimated 1.3 billion people experience significant disability **(World Health Organization)**, underscoring the necessity of these features. The **UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Article 9)** legally mandates accessible transportation to ensure full social participation.

As transport accessibility expert Dr. Victor Pineda states, **""Accessibility allows for the geography of opportunity to be available to everyone.""** This highlights that accessible transport is fundamental to social equity and economic empowerment."

Xi has also served as the president of the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) since 2013. He belongs to the fifth generation of Chinese leadership.The son of Chinese Communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, Xi was exiled to rural Yanchuan County as a teenager following his father\'s purge during the Cultural Revolution. He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China\'s coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as Hu Jintao\'s presumed successor as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed vice president of the PRC and vice chairman of the CMC. He officially received the title of leadership core from the CCP in 2016.Xi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China\'s relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China\'s African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. He has also promoted ""common prosperity"", a series of policies designed with stated goal to increase equality, and used the term to justify a broad crackdown and major slew of regulations against the tech and tutoring sectors in 2021. Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, the first time PRC and Republic of China leaders met, though relations deteriorated after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016. He responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China with a zero-COVID approach from January 2020 until December 2022, afterwards shifting towards a mitigation strategy. Xi also oversaw the passage of a national security law in Hong Kong, clamping down on political opposition in the city, especially pro-democracy activists.Often described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi\'s tenure has included an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights, including the internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang (which some observers have described as part of a genocide), a cult of personality developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi\'s political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. He and the CCP Central Committee passed a ""historical resolution"" in November 2021, the third such resolution after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to do so.Early life and educationXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi\'s father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People\'s Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An\'an (安安; Ān\'ān), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi\'s father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6]Xi went to the Beijing Bayi School,[7][8] and then the Beijing No. 25 School,[9] in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China\'s vice premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China\'s paramount leader.[10][11] In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[12] In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi\'s secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi\'s sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.[13]Later, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen\'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan\'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong\'s Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]The misfortunes and suffering of his family in his early years hardened Xi\'s view of politics. During an interview in 2000, he said, ""People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel. But what I see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. I see the bullpens and how people can blow hot and cold. I understand politics on a deeper level."" The ""bullpens"" (牛棚) was a reference to Red Guards\' detention houses during the Cultural Revolution.[16]After seven rejections, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 on his eighth attempt after he befriended a local official.[8] He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai.[13] From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974.[19][20][21] From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism–Leninism–Maoism and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and ""learning from the People\'s Liberation Army"".[22]Early political careerFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father\'s former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC.[8] In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982–1985), Fujian (1985–2002), Zhejiang (2002–2007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]From 1998 to 2002, Xi studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University,[26] graduating with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002.[27] In 1999, he was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, and became governor a year later. In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy.[28] In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC – general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing – to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.[29]In 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China\'s top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi\'s chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]Following the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months.[33][34] In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for ""national leaders"".[35] While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. He pledged there would be no \'purges\' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal.[36] On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.[37]Rise to powerXi was appointed to the nine-man PSC at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China\'s next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP\'s Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People\'s Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government\'s leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. He made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008.[39] After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of committee chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the PRC. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level CCP committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009.[40]Xi\'s position as the apparent successor to become the paramount leader was threatened with the rapid rise of Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time. Bo was expected to join the PSC at the 18th Party Congress, with most expecting that he would try to eventually maneuver himself into replacing Xi.[41] Bo\'s policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China and received praise from Xi himself during Xi\'s visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from Xi were later erased after he became paramount leader. Bo\'s downfall would come with the Wang Lijun incident, which opened the door for Xi to come to power without challengers.[42]Xi is considered one of the most successful members of the Princelings, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was ""a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations"".[43] Lee also commented: ""I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive"".[44] Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as ""the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line"".[45] Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi ""has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man"".[46]Trips as Vice PresidentIn February 2009, in his capacity as vice-president, Xi Jinping embarked on a tour of Latin America, visiting Mexico,[47] Jamaica,[48] Colombia,[49] Venezuela,[50] Brazil,[51] and Malta, after which he returned to China.[52] On 11 February 2009, while visiting Mexico, Xi spoke in front of a group of overseas Chinese and explained China\'s contributions during the international financial crisis, saying that it was ""the greatest contribution towards the whole of human race, made by China, to prevent its 1.3 billion people from hunger"".[c] He went on to remark: ""There are some bored foreigners, with full stomachs, who have nothing better to do than point fingers at us. First, China doesn\'t export revolution; second, China doesn\'t export hunger and poverty; third, China doesn\'t come and cause you headaches. What more is there to be said?""[d][53] The story was reported on some local television stations. The news led to a flood of discussions on Chinese Internet forums and it was reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was caught off-guard by Xi\'s remarks, as the actual video was shot by some accompanying Hong Kong reporters and broadcast on Hong Kong TV, which then turned up on various Internet video websites.[54]In the European Union, Xi visited Belgium, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania from 7 to 21 October 2009.[55] He visited Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, and Myanmar on his Asian trip from 14 to 22 December 2009.[56] He later visited the United States, Ireland and Turkey in February 2012. This visit included meeting with then U.S. president Barack Obama at the White House[57] and then vice president Joe Biden; and stops in California and Iowa, where he met with the family that previously hosted him during his 1985 tour as a Hebei provincial official.[58]Accession to top postsA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors.[8] He then reappeared on 15 September.[59] On 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. The following day Xi led the new line-up of the PSC onto the stage in their first public appearance.[60] The PSC was reduced from nine to seven, with only Xi and Li Keqiang retaining their seats; the other five members were new.[61][62][63] In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, Xi\'s first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention his predecessors.[64] Xi mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, ""Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment."" Xi also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that it would threaten the CCP\'s survival; he was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.[65]In December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of the trip was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as following in the footsteps of Deng\'s own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng\'s reforms in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan, the ""Chinese Dream"". ""This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military"", Xi told sailors.[66] Xi\'s trip was significant in that he departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders\' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. He travelled in a large van with his colleagues rather than a fleet of limousines, and did not restrict traffic on the parts of the highway he travelled.[67]Xi was elected president on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People\'s Congress in Beijing. He received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions.[60] He replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms.[68] In his new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 Xi expressed support for non-interference in China–Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn that country over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War.[69] On 17 March, Xi and his new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming his support for Leung.[70] Within hours of his election, Xi discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to China the following week.[71]LeadershipAnti-corruption campaignXi vowed to crack down on corruption almost immediately after he ascended to power at the 18th Party Congress. In his inaugural speech as general secretary, Xi mentioned that fighting corruption was one of the toughest challenges for the party.[72] A few months into his term, Xi outlined the Eight-point Regulation, listing rules intended to curb corruption and waste during official party business; it aimed at stricter discipline on the conduct of party officials. Xi also vowed to root out ""tigers and flies"", that is, high-ranking officials and ordinary party functionaries.[73]Xi initiated cases against former CMC vice-chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, former PSC member and security chief Zhou Yongkang and former Hu Jintao chief aide Ling Jihua.[74] Along with new disciplinary chief Wang Qishan, Xi\'s administration spearheaded the formation of ""centrally-dispatched inspection teams"" (中央巡视组). These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing. Many of the work teams also had the effect of identifying and initiating investigations of high-ranking officials. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign. These included former and current regional officials (Su Rong, Bai Enpei, Wan Qingliang), leading figures of state-owned enterprises and central government organs (Song Lin, Liu Tienan), and highly ranked generals in the military (Gu Junshan). In June 2014, the Shanxi provincial political establishment was decimated, with four officials dismissed within a week from the provincial party organization\'s top ranks. Within the first two years of the campaign alone, over 200,000 low-ranking officials received warnings, fines, and demotions.[75]The campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including members of the PSC.[76] Xi\'s anti-corruption campaign is seen by critics, such as The Economist, as a political tool with the aim of removing potential opponents and consolidating power.[77][78] Xi\'s establishment of a new anti-corruption agency, the National Supervision Commission, ranked higher than the supreme court, has been described by Amnesty International\'s East Asia director as a ""systemic threat to human rights"" that ""places tens of millions of people at the mercy of a secretive and virtually unaccountable system that is above the law.""[79][80]Xi has overseen significant reforms of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP\'s highest internal control institution.[81] He and CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan further institutionalized CCDI\'s independence from the day-to-day operations of the CCP, improving its ability to function as a bona fide control body.[81] According to The Wall Street Journal, any anti-corruption punishment to officials at or above the vice ministerial level need approval from Xi.[82] Another article from The Wall Street Journal said that when he wants to neutralize a political rival, he asks inspectors to prepare hundreds of pages of evidence. The article also said that he sometimes authorizes investigations on close associates of a high-ranking politician to replace them with his own proteges and puts political rivals in less important positions to separate them from their political bases. Reportedly, these tactics have even been used against Wang Qishan, Xi\'s close friend.[83]According to historian and sinologist Wang Gungwu, Xi Jinping inherited a political party that was faced with pervasive corruption.[84][85] Xi believed that the amount of corruption at the higher levels of the CCP put both the party and the country at risk of collapse.[84] Wang further adds that Xi has a belief that only the CCP is capable of governing China, and that a collapse of the party would be disastrous for the Chinese people. Xi and the new generational leaders reacted by launching the anti-corruption campaign to eliminate corruption at the higher levels of the government.[84]CensorshipSince Xi became the CCP general secretary, censorship, including internet censorship, has been significantly stepped up.[86][87] Chairing the 2018 China Cyberspace Governance Conference on 20 and 21 April 2018, Xi committed to ""fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking, telecom fraud, and violation of citizens\' privacy.""[88] During a visit to Chinese state media, Xi stated that ""party and government-owned media must hold the family name of the party"" (党和政府主办的媒体必须姓党) and that the state media ""must embody the party\'s will, safeguard the party\'s authority"".[89]His administration has overseen more Internet restrictions imposed in China, and is described as being ""stricter across the board"" on speech than previous administrations.[90] Xi has taken a very strong stand to control internet usage inside China, including Google and Facebook,[91] advocating Internet censorship in the country under the concept of internet sovereignty.[92][93] The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; in April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China.[94] Likewise, the situation for users of Weibo has been described as a change from fearing that individual posts would be deleted, or at worst one\'s account, to fear of arrest.[95]A law enacted in September 2013 authorized a three-year prison term for bloggers who shared more than 500 times any content considered ""defamatory"".[96] The State Internet Information Department summoned a group of influential bloggers to a seminar instructing them to avoid writing about politics, the CCP, or making statements contradicting official narratives. Many bloggers stopped writing about controversial topics, and Weibo went into decline, with much of its readership shifting to WeChat users speaking to very limited social circles.[96] In 2017, telecommunications carriers in China were instructed by the government to block individuals\' use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) by February 2018.[97]Xi has spoken out against ""historical nihilism"", meaning historical viewpoints that challenge the official line of the CCP.[98] Xi said that one of the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union has been historical nihilism.[99] The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has established a telephone hotline for people to report acts of historical nihilism, while Toutiao and Douyin urged its user to report instances of historical nihilism.[100] In May 2021, the CAC reported that it removed two million online posts for historical nihilism.[101]Consolidation of powerPolitical observers have called Xi the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, especially since the ending of presidential two-term limits in 2018.[102][103][104][105] Xi has notably departed from the collective leadership practices of his post-Mao predecessors. He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration.[106] Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier.[107]Xi also became the leader of the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, in charge of cyber-security and Internet policy. The Third Plenum held in 2013 also saw the creation of the National Security Commission of the CCP, another body chaired by Xi, which commentators have said would help Xi consolidate over national security affairs.[108][109] In the opinion of at least one political scientist, Xi ""has surrounded himself with cadres he met while stationed on the coast, Fujian and Shanghai and in Zhejiang.""[110] Control of Beijing is seen as crucial to Chinese leaders; Xi has selected Cai Qi, one of the cadres mentioned above, to manage the capital.[111] Xi was also believed to have diluted the authority of premier Li Keqiang, taking authority over the economy which has generally been considered to be the domain of the premier.[112][113]Since coming to power, various observers have said that Xi has seriously diluted the influence of the once-dominant ""Tuanpai"", also called the Youth League Faction, which were CCP officials who rose through the Party\'s Communist Youth League (CYLC).[114] He criticized the cadres of the CYLC, saying that [these cadres] can\'t talk about science, literature and art, work or life [with young people]. All they can do is just repeat the same old bureaucratic, stereotypical talk.""[115] Its budget was also cut, dropping from around 700 million yuan ($96 million) in 2012 to 260 million yuan ($40 million) in 2021, while its membership dropped from 90 million to 74 million in the same period.[114] He also led to the closure of the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China, merging it with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and effectively demoted Qin Yizhi, first secretary of the CYLC, in 2017.[116]In March 2018, the National People\'s Congress (NPC) passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, the creation of a National Supervisory Commission, as well as enhancing the central role of the CCP.[117][118] On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi as president, now without term limits; Wang Qishan was appointed vice president.[119][120] The following day, Li Keqiang was reappointed premier and longtime allies of Xi, Xu Qiliang and Zhang Youxia, were voted in as vice-chairmen of the CMC.[121] Foreign minister Wang Yi was promoted to state councillor and General Wei Fenghe was named defence minister.[122] According to the Financial Times, Xi expressed his views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts—general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC—which have no term limits. However, Xi did not say whether he intended to serve as party general secretary, CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms.[123]In its sixth plenary session in November 2021, CCP adopted a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party\'s history. This was the third of its kind after ones adopted by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,[124][125] and the document for the first time credited Xi as being the ""main innovator"" of Xi Jinping Thought[126] while also declaring Xi\'s leadership as being ""the key to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"".[127] In comparison with the other historical resolutions, Xi\'s one did not herald a major change in how the CCP evaluated its history.[128] To accompany the historical resolution, the CCP promoted the terms Two Establishes and Two Safeguards, calling the CCP to unite around and protect Xi\'s core status within the party.[129] In 2022, Xi appointed his close ally Wang Xiaohong as the Minister of Public Security, giving him further control over the security establishment.[130]The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held between 16 and 22 October 2022, has overseen amendments in the CCP constitution and the re-election of Xi as general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC for a third term, with the overall result of the Congress being further strengthening of Xi\'s power.[131] The newly amended CCP constitution included the term two safeguards, reinforcing Xi\'s power.[132] It also included concepts promoted by Xi like common prosperity, ""Chinese-style modernization"" and ""whole-process people\'s democracy"".[133] Xi\'s re-election made him the first party leader since Mao Zedong to be chosen for a third term, though Deng Xiaoping ruled the country informally for a longer period.[134] Xi was further re-elected as the PRC president and chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission on 10 March 2023 during the opening of the 14th National People\'s Congress.[135]The new Politburo Standing Committee elected just after the CCP Congress was filled almost completely with people close to Xi, with four out of the seven members of the previous PSC including premier Li Keqiang and CPPCC chairman Wang Yang stepping down.[136] Li Qiang, a close Xi ally, became the second-ranking member of the PSC, and was further promoted to premier in 2023.[131][137] Other allies of Xi, including Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi have also joined the PSC, and became the first secretary of the CCP Secretariat, first vice premier, and secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection respectively.[138] The only remaining members of the previous PSC except Xi were Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, though their ranking and positions changed,[138] and became the NPC Standing Committee and CPPCC chairmen respectively on 10 March 2023.[139][140] Reuters remarked that the retirement of Wang Yang and Li Keqiang, as well as the demotion of vice premier Hu Chunhua from the Politburo meant the wipeout of Tuanpai,[114] while Willy Wo-Lap Lam wrote that there were no representatives from the Tuanpai or the Shanghai clique, leading to a total dominance of Xi\'s own faction.[141]Cult of personalityXi has had a cult of personality constructed around himself since entering office[142][143] with books, cartoons, pop songs and dance routines honouring his rule.[144] Following Xi\'s ascension to the leadership core of the CCP, he had been referred to as Xi Dada (习大大, Uncle or Papa Xi),[144][145] though this stopped in April 2016.[146] The village of Liangjiahe, where Xi was sent to work, has become a ""modern-day shrine"" decorated with CCP propaganda and murals extolling the formative years of his life.[147] The CCP\'s Politburo named Xi Jinping lingxiu (领袖), a reverent term for ""leader"" and a title previously only given to Mao Zedong and his immediate successor Hua Guofeng.[148][149][150] He is also sometimes called the ""pilot at the helm"" (领航掌舵).[151] On 25 December 2019, the Politburo officially named Xi as ""People\'s Leader"" (人民领袖; rénmín lǐngxiù), a title only Mao had held previously.[152]Economy and technologyXi was initially seen as a market reformist,[153] and the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee under him announced that ""market forces"" would begin to play a ""decisive"" role in allocating resources.[154] This meant that the state would gradually reduce its involvement in the distribution of capital, and restructure China\'s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to allow further competition, potentially by attracting foreign and private sector players in industries that were previously highly regulated. This policy aimed to address the bloated state sector that had unduly profited from an earlier round of re-structuring by purchasing assets at below-market prices, assets that were no longer being used productively. Xi also launched the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone in August 2013, which was seen as part of the economic reforms.[155] In However, by 2017, Xi\'s promise of economic reforms has been said to stall by experts.[156][153] In 2015, the Chinese stock market bubble popped, which led Xi to use state forces to fix the issue.[157] From 2012 to 2022, the share of the market value of private sector firms in China\'s top listed companies has increased from around 10% to over 40%.[158] He has also overseen the relaxation of restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and increased cross-border holdings of stocks and bonds.[158]Xi has increased state control over China\'s economy, voicing support for SOEs,[159][153] while also supporting the country\'s private sector.[160] CCP control of SOEs has increased under Xi, while some limited steps towards market liberalization, such as increasing mixed ownership of SOEs were also undertaken.[161] Under Xi, ""government guidance funds"", public-private investment funds set up by or for government bodies, have raised more than $900 billion for early funding to companies that work in sectors the government deems as strategic.[162] Xi has increased the role of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission at the expense of the State Council.[163] His administration made it easier for banks to issue mortgages, increased foreign participation in the bond market, and increased the national currency renminbi\'s global role, helping it to join IMF\'s basket of special drawing right.[164] In the 40th anniversary of the launching of Chinese economic reforms in 2018, he has promised to continue reforms but has warned that nobody ""can dictate to the Chinese people"".[165]Xi has also personally made eradicating extreme poverty through ""targeted poverty alleviation"" a key goal.[166] In 2021, Xi declared a ""complete victory"" over extreme poverty, saying that nearly 100 million people have been lifted out of poverty under his tenure, though some experts said that China\'s poverty threshold was relatively lower than the one set by the World Bank.[167] In 2020, premier Li Keqiang, citing the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that China still had 600 million people living with less than 1000 yuan ($140) a month, although an article from The Economist said that the methodology NBS used was flawed, stating that the figure took the combined income, which was then equally divided.[168]China\'s economy has grown under Xi, with GDP in nominal terms more than doubling from $8.53 trillion in 2012 to $17.73 trillion in 2021,[169] while China\'s nominal GDP per capita surpassed the world average in 2021,[170] though the rate of growth has slowed from 7.9% in 2012 to 6% in 2019.[171] Xi has stressed the importance of ""high-quality growth"" rather than ""inflated growth"".[172] He has additionally stated that China will focus on quality of economic growth and that it has abandoned a growth-at-all-costs strategy which Xi refers to as ""GDP heroism"".[173]: 22 Instead, Xi said that other social issues such as environmental protection are important.[173]: 22 His administration pursued a debt-deleveraging campaign, seeking to slow and cut the unsustainable amount of debt China has accrued during its economic growth.[174] Though China\'s total non-financial-sector debt-to-GDP ratio reached a record 270.9% by 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, it fell to reach around 262.5% by 2021 before going up again to 273.2% in 2022, mainly due to the pressure put by the zero-COVID policy to local finances.[175]Xi has circulated a policy called ""dual circulation"", meaning reorienting the economy towards domestic consumption while remaining open to foreign trade and investment.[176] Xi has also made boosting productivity in the economy a priority.[177] Xi has attempted to reform the property sector to combat the steep increase in the property prices and to cut Chinese economy\'s dependence on the real estate sector.[178] In the 19th CCP National Congress, Xi declared ""Houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation"".[179] In 2020, Xi\'s government formulated the ""three red lines"" policy that aimed to deleverage the heavily indebted property sector.[180] Xi additionally has supported a property tax, for which he has faced resistance from members of the CCP.[181]Xi\'s administration has promoted ""Made in China 2025"" plan that aims to make China self-reliant in key technologies, although publicly China de-emphasised this plan due to the outbreak of a trade war with the U.S. Since the outbreak of the trade war in 2018, Xi has revived calls for ""self-reliance"", especially on the matters of technology.[182] Domestic spending on R&D has significantly increased under Xi, surpassing the total of the European Union (EU) and reaching a record $564 billion in 2020.[183] In August 2022, Xi\'s administration has allocated more than $100 billion to support China\'s efforts at semiconductor independence.[184] The Chinese government has also supported technology companies like Huawei through grants, tax breaks, credit facilities and other forms of assistance, enabling their rise but also leading to countermeasures by the U.S.[185] Xi has also been personally involved in the development of Xiong\'an, a new area announced in 2017, planned to become a major metropolis near Beijing and Tianjin in Hebei province; the relocation aspect is estimated to last until 2035 while it is planned to developed into a ""modern socialist city"" by 2050.[186]Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a key feature of Chinese-style modernization. The common prosperity we are pursuing is for all, affluence both in material and spiritual life, but not for a small portion nor for uniform egalitarianism.— Xi Jinping during a speech in 2021[187]In November 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that Xi personally ordered a halt to Ant Group\'s initial public offering (IPO), in reaction to its founder Jack Ma criticizing government regulation in finance.[188] Xi\'s administration has also overseen a decrease in offshore IPOs by Chinese companies, with most Chinese IPOs taking place either in Shanghai or Shenzhen as of 2022[update], and has increasingly directed funding to IPOs of companies that works in sectors it deems as strategic, including electric vehicles, biotechnology, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and other high-technology manufacturing.[162]Since 2021, Xi has promoted the term ""common prosperity"", a term which he defined as an ""essential requirement of socialism"", described as affluence for all and said entailed reasonable adjustments to excess incomes.[187][189] Common prosperity has been used as the justification for large-scale crackdowns and regulations towards the perceived ""excesses"" of several sectors, most prominently tech and tutoring industries.[190] The examples of actions taken against tech companies have included fining large tech companies[191] and passing of laws such as the Data Security Law. China also banned private tutoring companies from making profits and teaching school syllabus during weekends and holidays, effectively destroying the whole industry.[192] Xi additionally opened a new stock exchange in Beijing targeted for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which was another part of his common prosperity campaign.[193] There have also been other numerous cultural regulations, such as limiting video game usage by minors to 90 minutes during weekdays and 3 hours during weekends,[194] complete banning of cryptocurrency,[195] cracking down on idol worship, fandom and celebrity culture[196] and cracking down on ""sissy men"".[197] The Wall Street Journal has also reported in October 2021 that Xi had launched a round of inspections of the country\'s financial institutions, including state-owned banks, investment funds and financial regulators, on whether their ties to private firms had become too close, with the investigations being led by Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.[198]ReformsIn November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy. Xi signaled at the plenum that he was consolidating control of the massive internal security organization that was formerly the domain of Zhou Yongkang.[154] A new National Security Commission was formed with Xi at its helm. The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms—another ad hoc policy coordination body led by Xi upgraded to a commission in 2018—was also formed to oversee the implementation of the reform agenda.[199] Termed ""comprehensive deepening reforms"" (全面深化改革; quánmiàn shēnhuà gǎigé), they were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping\'s 1992 Southern Tour. The plenum also announced economic reforms and resolved to abolish the laogai system of ""re-education through labour"", which was largely seen as a blot on China\'s human rights record. The system has faced significant criticism for years from domestic critics and foreign observers.[154] In January 2016, a two-child policy replaced the one-child policy,[200] which was in turn was replaced with a three-child policy in May 2021.[201] In July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[202]Political reformsXi\'s administration taken a number of changes to the structure of the CCP and state bodies, especially in a large overhaul in 2018. In March 2014, the CCP Central Committee merged the Office for External Propaganda (OEP), externally known as the State Council Information Office (SCIO), to the CCP\'s Central Propaganda Department. SCIO is now used by the Central Propaganda Department as an external name under an arrangement called ""one institution with two names"".[203] February earlier that year oversaw the creation of the Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and Informatization. The State Internet Information Office (SIIO), previously under the OEP and SCIO, was transferred to the central leading group and renamed in English into the Cyberspace Administration of China.[204] As part of managing the financial system, the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body, was established in 2017. Chaired by vice premier Liu He during its existence, the committee was disestablished by the newly established Central Financial Commission during the 2023 Party and state reforms.[205]2018 has seen larger reforms to the bureaucracy. In that year, several central leading groups including reform, cyberspace affairs, finance and economics. and foreign affairs were upgraded to commissions.[206][207] In the area of media, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) was renamed into the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) with its film, news media and publications being transferred to the Central Propaganda Department.[207] Additionally, the control of China Central Television (CCTV, including its international edition, China Global Television), China National Radio (CNR) and China Radio International (CRI) were transferred to the newly established China Media Group (CMG) under the control of the Central Propaganda Department.[207][208] Two State Council departments. one dealing with overseas Chinese, and other one dealing with religious affairs, were merged into the United Front Work Department while another commission dealing with ethnic affairs was brought under formal UFWD leadership.[207]2023 has seen further reforms to the CCP and state bureaucracy, most notably the strengthening of Party control over the financial and technology domains.[209] This included the creation of two CCP bodies for overseeing finance; the Central Financial Commission (CFC), as well as the revival of the Central Financial Work Commission (CFWC) that was previously dissolved in 2002.[209] The CFC would broadly manage the financial system while the CFWC would focus on strengthening the ideological and political role of the CCP in the sector.[205] Additionally, a new CCP Central Science and Technology Commission would be established to broadly oversee the technology sector, while a newly created Social Work Department was tasked with CCP interactions with several sectors, including civic groups, chambers of commerce and industry groups, as well as handling public petition and grievance work.[209] A new Central Hong Kong and Macau Work Office would also be established, with the State Council\'s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office being turned into the new body\'s external name.[209]At the State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was replaced by the National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), which is taking a much larger responsibility on financial regulation, effectively overseeing all financial activities except the securities industry, which was continued to be regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, now elevated to a government body.[210] Several regulatory responsibilities were also transferred from the People\'s Bank of China (PBoC) to the SAFS, while the PBoC will also reopen offices around the country that were closed in a previous reorganization.[211]Legal reformsEfforts should be made to enable the people to see that justice is served in every judicial case.— Xi Jinping during a speech in November 2020[212]The party under Xi announced a raft of legal reforms at the Fourth Plenum held in the fall 2014, and he called for ""Chinese socialistic rule of law"" immediately afterwards. The party aimed to reform the legal system, which had been perceived as ineffective at delivering justice and affected by corruption, local government interference and lack of constitutional oversight. The plenum, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People\'s Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution.[213] It also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall ""professionalization"" of the legal workforce. The party also planned to institute cross-jurisdictional circuit legal tribunals as well as giving provinces consolidated administrative oversight over lower level legal resources, which is intended to reduce local government involvement in legal proceedings.[214]Military reformsSince taking power in 2012, Xi has undertaken an overhaul of the People\'s Liberation Army, including both political reform and its modernization.[215] Military-civil fusion has advanced under Xi.[216][217] Xi has been active in his participation in military affairs, taking a direct hands-on approach to military reform. In addition to being the Chairman of the CMC and leader of the Central Leading Group for Military Reform founded in 2014 to oversee comprehensive military reforms, Xi has delivered numerous high-profile pronouncements vowing to clean up malfeasance and complacency in the military. Xi has repeatedly warned that the depoliticization of the PLA from the CCP would lead to a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union.[218] Xi held the New Gutian Conference in 2014, gathering China\'s top military officers, re-emphasizing the principle of ""the party has absolute control over the army"" first established by Mao at the 1929 Gutian Conference.[219]In the USSR, where the military was depoliticized, separated from the party and nationalized, the party was disarmed. When the Soviet Union came to crisis point, a big party was gone just like that. Proportionally, the Soviet Communist Party had more members than we do, but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.— Xi Jinping during a speech[220]Though predating Xi, his administration has taken a more assertive stance towards maritime affairs, and has boosted CCP control over the maritime security forces.[221] In 2013, the previously separate rival maritime law enforcements of China were merged into the China Coast Guard. Initially under the joint administration of the State Oceanic Administration and the Ministry of Public Security, it was placed squarely under the administration of the People\'s Armed Police (PAP) in 2018.[221]Xi announced a reduction of 300,000 troops from the PLA in 2015, bringing its size to 2 million troops. Xi described this as a gesture of peace, while analysts such as Rory Medcalf have said that the cut was done to reduce costs as well as part of PLA\'s modernization.[222] On 2016, he reduced the number of theater commands of the PLA from seven to five.[223] He has also abolished the four autonomous general departments of the PLA, replacing them with 15 agencies directly reporting to the CMC.[215] Two new branches of the PLA were created under his reforms, the Strategic Support Force[224] and the Joint Logistics Support Force.[225] In 2018, the PAP was placed under the sole control of the CMC; the PAP was previously under the joint command of the CMC and the State Council through the Ministry of Public Security.[226]: 15On 21 April 2016, Xi was named commander-in-chief of the country\'s new Joint Operations Command Center of the PLA by Xinhua News Agency and the broadcaster China Central Television.[227][228] Some analysts interpreted this move as an attempt to display strength and strong leadership and as being more ""political than military"".[229] According to Ni Lexiong, a military affairs expert, Xi ""not only controls the military but also does it in an absolute manner, and that in wartime, he is ready to command personally"".[230] According to a University of California, San Diego expert on Chinese military, Xi ""has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done"".[231]Under Xi, China\'s official military budget has more than doubled,[183] reaching a record $224 billion in 2023.[232] The PLA Navy has grown rapidly under Xi, with China adding more warships, submarines, support ships and major amphibious vessels than the than the entire number of ships under the United Kingdom navy between 2014 and 2018.[233] In 2017, China established the navy\'s first overseas base in Djibouti.[234] Xi has also undertaken an expansion of China\'s nuclear arsenal, with him calling China to ""establish a strong system of strategic deterrence"". The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has estimated China\'s total amount of nuclear arsenals to be 410 in 2023, with the US Department of Defense estimating that China\'s arsenal could reach 1,000 by 2030.[235]Foreign policyXi has taken a harder line on security issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic and assertive China on the world stage.[236] His political program calls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure.[237] Foreign analysts and observers have frequently said that Xi\'s main foreign policy objective is to restore China\'s position on the global stage as a great power.[238][220][239] Xi advocates ""baseline thinking"" in China\'s foreign policy: setting explicit red lines that other countries must not cross.[240] In the Chinese perspective, these tough stances on baseline issues reduce strategic uncertainty, preventing other nations from misjudging China\'s positions or underestimating China\'s resolve in asserting what it perceives to be in its national interest.[240] Xi stated during the 20th CCP National Congress that he wanted to ensure China ""leads the world in terms of composite national strength and international influence"" by 2049.[241]Xi has promoted ""major-country diplomacy"" (大国外交), stating that China is already a ""big power"" and breaking away from previous Chinese leaders who had a more precautious diplomacy.[242] He has adopted a hawkish foreign policy posture called ""wolf warrior diplomacy"",[243] while his foreign policy thoughts are collectively known as ""Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy"".[244] In March 2021, he said that ""the East is rising and the West is declining"" (东升西降), saying that the power of the Western world was in decline and their COVID-19 response was an example of this, and that China was entering a period of opportunity because of this.[245] Xi has frequently alluded to ""community with a shared future for mankind"", which Chinese diplomats have said doesn\'t imply an intention to change the international order,[246] but which foreign observers say China wants a new order that puts it more at the centre.[247] Under Xi, China has, along with Russia, also focused on increasing relations with the Global South in order to blunt the effect of Western sanctions.[248]Xi has put an emphasis on increasing China\'s ""international discourse power"" (国际话语权) to create a more favorable global opinion of China in the world.[249] In this pursuit, Xi has emphasised the need to ""tell China\'s story well"" (讲好中国故事), meaning expanding China\'s external propaganda (外宣) and communications.[250] Xi has expanded the focus and scope of the united front, which aims to consolidate support for CCP in non-CCP elements both inside and outside China, and has accordingly expanded the United Front Work Department.[251] Xi has unveiled the Global Development Initiative (GDI),[252] the Global Security Initiative (GSI),[253] and the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI), in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, aiming to increase China\'s influence in the international order.[254]SecurityUnder Xi, China has promoted reformation of the international system, with Xi calling for a ""rejection of hegemonic power structures in global governance"".[255] Addressing a regional conference in Shanghai on 21 May 2014, he called on Asian countries to unite and forge a way together, rather than get involved with third party powers, seen as a reference to the United States. ""Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians. Asia\'s problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians and Asia\'s security ultimately must be protected by Asians"", he told the conference.[256] His proposed Global Security Initiative has been aiming to create a new global security architecture, incorporating the term ""indivisible security"", a concept also supported by Russia.[253] He has also advocated for international security cooperation; during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in September 2021, he spoke out against ""interference in other countries\' internal affairs"", and called for joint cooperation in warding off against ""colour revolutions"".[257]AfricaUnder Xi, China has cut back lending to Africa after fears that African countries couldn\'t repay their debts to China.[258] Xi has also promised that China would write off debts of some African countries.[259] In November 2021, Xi promised African nations 1 billion doses of China\'s COVID-19 vaccines, which was in addition to the 200 million already supplied before. This has been said to be part of China\'s vaccine diplomacy.[260]European UnionChina\'s efforts under Xi has been for the European Union (EU) to stay in a neutral position in their contest with the U.S.[261] China and the EU announced the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in 2020, although the deal was later frozen due to mutual sanctions over Xinjiang.[262] Xi has supported calls for EU to achieve ""strategic autonomy"",[263] and has also called on the EU to view China ""independently"".[264]IndiaRelations between China and India had ups and downs under Xi, later deteriorating due to various factors. In 2013, the two countries had a standoff in Depsang for three weeks, which ended with no border change.[265] In 2017, the two countries again had a standoff over a Chinese construction of a road in Doklam, a territory both claimed by Bhutan, India\'s ally, and China,[266] though by 28 August, both countries mutually disengaged.[267] The most serious crisis in the relationship came when the two countries had a deadly clash in 2020 at the Line of Actual Control, leaving some soldiers dead.[268][269] The clashes created a serious deterioration in relations, with China seizing a small chunk of territory that India controlled.[270]JapanChina–Japan relations have initially soured under Xi\'s administration; the most thorny issue between the two countries remains the dispute over the Senkaku islands, which China calls Diaoyu. In response to Japan\'s continued robust stance on the issue, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in November 2013.[271] However, the relations later started to improve, with Xi being invited to visit in 2020,[272] though the trip was later delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[273] In August 2022, Kyodo News reported that Xi personally decided to let ballistic missiles land within Japan\'s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) during the military exercises held around Taiwan, to send a warning to Japan.[274]Middle EastWhile China has historically been wary of getting closer to the Middle East countries, Xi has changed this approach.[275] China has grown closer to both Iran and Saudi Arabia under Xi.[275] During a visit to Iran in 2016, Xi proposed a large cooperation program with Iran,[276] a deal that was later signed in 2021.[277] China has also sold ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia and is helping build 7,000 schools in Iraq.[275] In 2013, Xi proposed a peace deal between Israel and Palestine that entails a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.[278] Turkey, with whom relations were long strained over Uyghurs, has also grown closer to China.[279] On 10 March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties cut in 2016 after a deal brokered between the two countries by China following secret talks in Beijing.[280]North KoreaUnder Xi, China initially took a more critical stance on North Korea due to its nuclear tests.[281] However, starting in 2018, the relations started to improve due to meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.[282] Xi has also supported denuclearization of North Korea,[283] and has voiced support for economic reforms in the country.[284] At the G20 meeting in Japan, Xi called for a ""timely easing"" of sanctions imposed on North Korea.[285] After the 20th CCP National Congress in 2022, Rodong Sinmun, official newspaper of the ruling Workers\' Party of Korea, wrote a long editorial praising Xi, titling both Kim and Xi Suryong (수령), a title historically reserved for North Korea\'s founder Kim Il Sung.[286]RussiaXi has cultivated stronger relations with Russia, particularly in the wake of the Ukraine crisis of 2014. He seems to have developed a strong personal relationship with president Vladimir Putin. Both are viewed as strong leaders with a nationalist orientation who are not afraid to assert themselves against Western interests.[287] Xi attended the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Under Xi, China signed a $400 billion gas deal with Russia; China has also become Russia\'s largest trading partner.[287]Xi and Putin met on 4 February 2022 during the run up to the 2022 Beijing Olympics during the massive Russian build-up of force on the Ukrainian border, with the two expressing that the two countries are nearly united in their anti-US alignment and that both nations shared ""no limits"" to their commitments.[288][289] U.S. officials said that China had asked Russia to wait for the invasion of Ukraine until after the Beijing Olympics ended on 20 February.[289] In April 2022, Xi Jinping expressed opposition to sanctions against Russia.[290] On 15 June 2022, Xi Jinping reasserted China\'s support for Russia on issues of sovereignty and security.[291] However, Xi also said China is committed to respecting ""the territorial integrity of all countries"",[292] and said China was ""pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe"".[293] China has additionally kept a distance from Russia\'s actions, instead putting itself as a neutral party.[289] In February 2023, China released a 12-point peace plan to ""settle the acute crisis in Ukraine""; the plan was praised by Putin but criticized by the U.S. and European countries.[294]During the war Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given a nuanced take to China,[295] saying that the country has the economic leverage to pressure Putin to end the war, adding ""I\'m sure that without the Chinese market for the Russian Federation, Russia would be feeling complete economic isolation. That\'s something that China can do – to limit the trade [with Russia] until the war is over."" In August 2022, Zelenskyy said that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping did not respond to his requests for direct talks with him.[296] He additionally said that while he would like China to take a different approach to the war in Ukraine, he also wanted the relationship to improve every year and said that China and Ukraine shared similar values.[297] On 26 April 2023, Zelenskyy and Xi held their first phone call since the start of the war.[298]South KoreaXi has initially improved relationships with South Korea,[281] and the two countries signed a free-trade agreement in December 2015.[299] Starting in 2017, China\'s relationship with South Korea soured over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), a missile defence system, purchase of the latter. which China sees as a threat but which South Korea says is a defence measure against North Korea.[300] Ultimately, South Korea halted the purchase of the THAAD after China imposed unofficial sanctions.[301] China\'s relations with South Korea improved again under president Moon Jae-in.[302]Southeast AsiaSince Xi came to power, China has been rapidly building and militarizing islands in the South China Sea, a decision Study Times of the Central Party School said was personally taken by Xi.[303] In April 2015, new satellite imagery revealed that China was rapidly constructing an airfield on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea.[304] In November 2014, in a major policy address, Xi called for a decrease in the use of force, preferring dialogue and consultation to solve the current issues plaguing the relationship between China and its South East Asian neighbors.[305]TaiwanIn 2015, Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou, which marked the first time the political leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait have met since the end of the Chinese Civil War in Mainland China in 1950.[306] Xi said that China and Taiwan are ""one family"" that cannot be pulled apart.[307] However, the relations started deteriorating after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016.[308]In the 19th Party Congress held in 2017, Xi reaffirmed six of the nine principles that had been affirmed continuously since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, with the notable exception of ""Placing hopes on the Taiwan people as a force to help bring about unification"".[309] According to the Brookings Institution, Xi used stronger language on potential Taiwan independence than his predecessors towards previous DPP governments in Taiwan.[309] He said that ""we will never allow any person, any organisation, or any political party to split any part of the Chinese territory from China at any time at any form.""[309] In March 2018, Xi said that Taiwan would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempts at separatism.[310]In January 2019, Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject its formal independence from China, saying: ""We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means."" Those options, he said, could be used against ""external interference"". Xi also said that they ""are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities.""[311][312] President Tsai responded to the speech by saying Taiwan would not accept a one country, two systems arrangement with the mainland, while stressing the need for all cross-strait negotiations to be on a government-to-government basis.[313]In 2022, after the Chinese military exercises around Taiwan, the PRC published a white paper called ""The Taiwan Question and China\'s Reunification in the New Era"", which was the first white paper regards to Taiwan since 2000.[314] The paper urged Taiwan to become a special administrative region of the PRC under the one country two systems formula,[314] and said that ""a small number of countries, the U.S. foremost amongst them"" are ""using Taiwan to contain China"".[315] Notably, the new white paper excluded a part that previously said the PRC would not send troops or officials to Taiwan after unification.[315]United StatesXi has called China–United States relations in the contemporary world a ""new type of great-power relations"", a phrase the Obama administration had been reluctant to embrace.[316] Under his administration the U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue that began under Hu Jintao has continued, until it was suspended by the administration of Donald Trump.[317] On China–U.S. relations, Xi said, ""If [China and the United States] are in confrontation, it would surely spell disaster for both countries"".[318] The U.S. has been critical of Chinese actions in the South China Sea.[316] In 2014, Chinese hackers compromised the computer system of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,[319] resulting in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel records handled by the office.[320] Xi has also indirectly spoken out critically on the U.S. ""strategic pivot"" to Asia.[321]Relations with the U.S. soured after Donald Trump became president in 2017.[322] Since 2018, U.S. and China have been engaged in an escalating trade war.[323] In 2020, the relations further deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[324] In 2021, Xi has called the U.S. the biggest threat to China\'s development, saying that ""the biggest source of chaos in the present-day world is the United States"".[245] Xi has also scrapped a previous policy in which China did not challenge the U.S. in most instances, while Chinese officials said that they now see China as an ""equal"" to the U.S.[325] On 6 March 2023, during a speech to the Chinese People\'s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi said that ""Western countries—led by the U.S.—have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression"" against China, which he said brought ""unprecedentedly severe challenges to our country\'s development"".[326]Foreign trips as paramount leaderXi made his first foreign trip as China\'s paramount leader to Russia on 22 March 2013, about a week after he assumed the presidency. He met with President Vladimir Putin and the two leaders discussed trade and energy issues. He then went on to Tanzania, South Africa (where he attended the BRICS summit in Durban), and the Republic of the Congo.[327] Xi visited the United States at Sunnylands Estate in California in a \'shirtsleeves summit\' with U.S. President Barack Obama in June 2013, although this was not considered a formal state visit.[328] In October 2013, Xi attended the APEC Summit in Bali, Indonesia.In March 2014, Xi made a trip to Western Europe visiting the Netherlands, where he attended the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague,[329] followed by visits to France, Germany and Belgium.[330] He made a state visit to South Korea on 4 July 2014 and met with South Korean President Park Geun-hye.[331] Between 14 and 23 July, Xi attended the BRICS leaders\' summit in Brazil and visited Argentina, Venezuela, and Cuba.[332]Xi went on an official state visit to India and met with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in September 2014; he visited New Delhi and also went to Modi\'s hometown in the state of Gujarat.[333] He went on a state visit to Australia and met with Prime Minister Tony Abbott in November 2014,[334] followed by a visit to the island nation of Fiji.[335] Xi visited Pakistan in April 2015, signing a series of infrastructure deals worth $45 billion related to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. During his visit, Pakistan\'s highest civilian award, the Nishan-e-Pakistan, was conferred upon him.[336] He then headed to Jakarta and Bandung, Indonesia, to attend the Afro-Asian Leaders Summit and the 60th Anniversary events of the Bandung Conference.[337] Xi visited Russia and was the guest-of-honour of Russian president Vladimir Putin at the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade to mark the 70th Anniversary of the victory of the allies in Europe. At the parade, Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan sat next to Putin. On the same trip Xi also visited Kazakhstan and met with that country\'s president Nursultan Nazarbayev, and also met Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus.[338]In September 2015, Xi made his first state visit to the United States.[339][340][341] In October 2015, he made a state visit to the United Kingdom, the first by a Chinese leader in a decade.[342] This followed a visit to China in March 2015 by the Duke of Cambridge. During the state visit, Xi met Queen Elizabeth II, British prime minister David Cameron and other dignitaries. Increased customs, trade, and research collaborations between China and the U.K. were discussed, but more informal events also took place including a visit to Manchester City\'s football academy.[343]In March 2016, Xi visited the Czech Republic on his way to the United States. In Prague, he met with the Czech president, prime minister and other representatives to promote relations and economic cooperation between the Czech Republic and the PRC.[344] His visit was met by a considerable number of protests by Czechs.[345]In January 2017, Xi became the first Chinese paramount leader to plan to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos.[346] On 17 January, Xi addressed the forum in a high-profile keynote, addressing globalization, the global trade agenda, and China\'s rising place in the world\'s economy and international governance; he made a series of pledges about China\'s defense of ""economic globalization"" and climate change accords.[346][347][348] Premier Li Keqiang attended the forum in 2015 and Vice-president Li Yuanchao did so in 2016. During the three-day state visit to the country in 2017 Xi also visited the World Health Organization, the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee.[348]On 20 June 2019, Xi visited Pyongyang, becoming the first Chinese leader to visit North Korea since his predecessor Hu Jintao\'s visit in 2004.[349] On 27 June, he attended the G20 summit in Osaka.[350] On 17 January 2020, Xi visited Myanmar, meeting president Win Myint, state councillor Aung San Suu Kyi and military leader Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw.[351]Between 2020 and 2022, Xi paused foreign travel, speculated to be due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[352] On 14 February 2022, Xi visited Astana, Kazakhstan, his first trip overseas since the start of the pandemic, meeting president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.[353] A day later, he visited Uzbekistan to attend the 2022 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. There he met with Central Asian leaders as well as Russian president Vladimir Putin, his first since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.[354][355]Between 15 and 16 November 2022, Xi attended the G20 Summit in Bali, meeting numerous world leaders including the US president Joe Biden, Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, French president Emmanuel Macron[356] and South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol.[357][358] Between 16 and 19 November, he attended the APEC Summit in Thailand, meeting leaders including Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida,[359] New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern,[360] Thai prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha[361] and US vice president Kamala Harris.[362] Between 7 and 10 December, he visited Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he met king Salman, and crown prince and prime minister Mohammed bin Salman. He also met with numerous Arab leaders, including members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.[363] During the meeting, he signed numerous commercial deals with Saudi Arabia and formally elevated the relationship to comprehensive strategic partnership, highest level in China\'s formal ranking of relations with other countries.[364]Between 20 and 22 March 2023, Xi visited Moscow, Russia, in what was his first trip overseas after the 2023 National People\'s Congress. The visited came at the backdrop of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, as well as an arrest warrant for Russian president Vladimir Putin issued by the International Criminal Court.[365] During the visit, Xi met with Putin, as well as prime minister Mikhail Mishustin.[366] Putin and Xi signed a joint statement vowing to expand ties, and officially promoted a new ""multipolar world"".[365] Between 22 and 24 August, Xi visited Johannesburg, South Africa to attend the 15th BRICS summit, where he met with various BRICS leaders, as well as various leaders from the African continent.[367]Economic relationsThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was unveiled by Xi in September and October 2013 during visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia,[368] and was thereafter promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during state visits to Asia and Europe. Xi made the announcement for the initiative while in Astana, Kazakhstan, and called it a ""golden opportunity"".[369] BRI has been called Xi\'s ""signature project"", involving numerous infrastructure development and investment projects throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas.[370] BRI was added to the CCP Constitution at the closing session of the 19th Party Congress on 24 October 2017,[371] further elevating its importance.[372] Since the BRI was launched, China became the world\'s largest lender, lending about $1 trillion in a decade to almost 150 countries. However, by 2022, many BRI projects have stalled, and most of China\'s debt became held by countries in financial distress, leading the Chinese leaders to adopt a more conservative approach to BRI, dubbed as ""Belt and Road Initiative 2.0"".[373]Xi officially proposed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in October 2013 during a visit to Indonesia,[374] which officially launched in January 2016.[375] The membership of the AIIB has included numerous countries, including allies of the United States and Western countries, despite opposition from the US.[375] Since its launch until 2022, AIIB has invested $36.43 billion to 190 projects.[376] Xi\'s tenure has seen a signing of several free-trade deals, including with Australia in 2014,[377] South Korea in 2015,[299] and the larger Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020.[378] Xi has also expressed his interest in China joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), with China formally applying to join in September 2021.[379]National securityXi has devoted a large amount of work towards national security, calling for a ""holistic national security architecture"" that encompasses ""all aspects of the work of the party and the country"".[380] During a private talk with U.S. president Obama and vice president Biden, he said that China had been a target of ""colour revolutions"", foreshadowing his focus on national security.[381] Since its creation by Xi, the National Security Commission has established local security committees, focusing on dissent.[381] In the name of national security, Xi\'s government has passed numerous laws including a counterespionage law in 2014,[382] national security[383] and a counterterrorism law in 2015,[384] a cybersecurity law[385] and a law restricting foreign NGOs in 2016,[386] a national intelligence law in 2017,[387] and a data security law in 2021.[388] Under Xi, China\'s mass surveillance network has dramatically grown, with comprehensive profiles being built for each citizen.[389]Hong KongDuring his leadership, Xi has supported and pursued a greater political and economic integration of Hong Kong to mainland China, including through projects such as the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge.[390] He has pushed for the Greater Bay Area project, which aims to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in Guangdong.[390] Xi\'s push for greater integration has created fears of decreasing freedoms in Hong Kong.[391] Many of the views held by the central government and eventually implemented in Hong Kong were outlined in a white paper published by the State Council in 2014 named The Practice of the \'One Country, Two Systems\' Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which outlined that the China\'s central government has ""comprehensive jurisdiction"" over Hong Kong.[392] Under Xi, the Chinese government also declared the Sino-British Joint Declaration to be legally void.[392]In August 2014, the Standing Committee of the National People\'s Congress (NPCSC) made a decision allowing universal suffrage for the 2017 election of the chief executive of Hong Kong, but also requiring the candidates to ""love the country, and love Hong Kong"", as well as other measures that ensured the Chinese leadership would be the ultimate decision-maker on the selection, leading to protests,[393] and the eventual rejection of the reform bill in the Legislative Council due to a walk-out by the pro-Beijing camp to delay to vote.[394] In the 2017 chief executive election, Carrie Lam was victorious, reportedly with the endorsement of the CCP Politburo.[395]Xi has supported the Hong Kong Government and Carrie Lam against the protesters in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, which broke out after a proposed bill that would allow extraditions to China.[396] He has defended the Hong Kong police\'s use of force, saying that ""We sternly support the Hong Kong police to take forceful actions in enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judiciary to punish in accordance with the law those who have committed violent crimes.""[397] While visiting Macau on 20 December 2019 as part of the 20th anniversary of its return to China, Xi warned of foreign forces interfering in Hong Kong and Macau,[398] while also hinting that Macau could be a model for Hong Kong to follow.[399]In 2020, the NPCSC passed a national security law in Hong Kong that dramatically expanded government clampdown over the opposition in the city; amongst the measures were the dramatic restriction on political opposition and the creation of a central government office outside Hong Kong jurisdiction to oversee the enforcement of the law.[392] This was seem as the culmination of a long-term project under Xi to further closely integrate Hong Kong with the mainland.[392] Xi visited Hong Kong as president in 2017 and 2022, in the 20th and 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong respectively.[400] In his 2022 visit, he swore in John Lee as chief executive, a former police officer that was backed by the Chinese government to expand control over the city.[401][402] While in the city, he said Hong Kong had moved from ""chaos"" to ""stability"".[403] Since John Lee became chief executive, Hong Kong government officials including Lee himself have shown public displays of loyalty towards Xi, similar to the mainland but previously unheard in the city.[404]Human rightsAccording to the Human Rights Watch, Xi has ""started a broad and sustained offensive on human rights"" since he became leader in 2012.[405] The HRW also said that repression in China is ""at its worst level since the Tiananmen Square massacre.""[406] Since taking power, Xi has cracked down on grassroots activism, with hundreds being detained.[407] He presided over the 709 crackdown on 9 July 2015, which saw more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants and human rights activists being detained.[408] His term has seen the arrest and imprisonment of activists such as Xu Zhiyong, as well as numerous others who identified with the New Citizens\' Movement. Prominent legal activist Pu Zhiqiang of the Weiquan movement was also arrested and detained.[409]In 2017, the local government of the Jiangxi province told Christians to replace their pictures of Jesus with Xi Jinping as part of a general campaign on unofficial churches in the country.[410][411][412] According to local social media, officials ""transformed them from believing in religion to believing in the party"".[410] According to activists, ""Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982"", and according to pastors and a group that monitors religion in China, has involved ""destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith"".[413]Under Xi, the CCP has embraced assimilationist policies towards ethnic minorities, scaling back affirmative action in the country by 2019,[414] and scrapping a wording in October 2021 that guaranteed the rights of minority children to be educated in their native language, replacing it with one that emphasized teaching the national language.[415] In 2020, Chen Xiaojiang was appointed as head of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, the first Han Chinese head of the body since 1954.[416] On 24 June 2022, Pan Yue, another Han Chinese, became the head of the commission, with him reportedly holding assimilationist policies toward ethnic minorities.[417] Xi outlined his official views relations between the majority Han Chinese and ethnic minorities by saying ""[n]either Han chauvinism nor local ethnic chauvinism is conducive to the development of a community for the Chinese nation"".[418]XinjiangFollowing several terrorist attacks in Xinjiang in 2013 and 2014, the CCP leaders held a secret meeting to find a solution to the attacks,[419] leading to Xi to launch the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism in 2014, which involved mass detention, and surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs there.[420][421] Xi made an inspection tour in Xinjiang between 27 and 30 April in 2014.[422] The program was massively expanded in 2016, after the appointment of Chen Quanguo as the Xinjiang CCP secretary. The campaign included the detainment of 1.8 million people in internment camps, mostly Uyghurs but also including other ethnic and religious minorities, by 2020,[419] and a birth suppression campaign that led to a large drop in the Uyghur birth rate by 2019.[423] Various human rights groups and former inmates have described the camps as ""concentration camps"", where Uyghurs and other minorities have been forcibly assimilated into China\'s majority ethnic Han society.[424] This program has been called a genocide by some observers, while a report by the UN Human Rights Office said they may amount to crimes against humanity.[425][426]Internal Chinese government documents leaked to the press in November 2019 showed that Xi personally ordered a security crackdown in Xinjiang, saying that the party must show ""absolutely no mercy"" and that officials use all the ""weapons of the people\'s democratic dictatorship"" to suppress those ""infected with the virus of extremism"".[421][427] The papers also showed that Xi repeatedly discussed about Islamic extremism in his speeches, likening it to a ""virus"" or a ""drug"" that could be only addressed by ""a period of painful, interventionary treatment.""[421] However, he also warned against the discrimination against Uyghurs and rejected proposals to eradicate Islam in China, calling that kind of viewpoint ""biased, even wrong"".[421] Xi\'s exact role in the building of internment camps has not been publicly reported, though he\'s widely believed to be behind them and his words have been the source for major justifications in the crackdown in Xinjiang.[428][429] In the Xinjiang Police Files leaked in 2022, a document quoting Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi suggested that Xi had been aware of the internment camps.[430]COVID-19 pandemicOn 20 January 2020, Xi commented for the first time on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, and ordered ""efforts to curb the spread"" of the virus.[431] He gave premier Li Keqiang some responsibility over the COVID-19 response, in what has been suggested by The Wall Street Journal was an attempt to potentially insulate himself from criticism if the response failed.[432] The government initially responded to the pandemic with a lockdown and censorship, with the initial response causing widespread backlash within China.[433] He met with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), on 28 January.[434] Der Spiegel reported that in January 2020 Xi pressured Tedros Adhanom to hold off on issuing a global warning about the outbreak of COVID-19 and hold back information on human-to-human transmission of the virus, allegations denied by the WHO.[435] On 5 February, Xi met with Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen in Beijing, the first foreign leader allowed into China since the outbreak.[434] After the COVID-19 outbreak got under control in Wuhan, Xi visited the city on 10 March.[436]After getting the outbreak in Wuhan under control, Xi has favoured what has officially been termed ""dynamic zero-COVID policy""[437] that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country\'s borders. This has involved local lockdowns and mass-testing.[438] While initially credited for China\'s suppression of the COVID-19 outbreak, the policy was later criticized by foreign and some domestic observers for being out of touch with the rest of the world and taking a heavy toll on the economy.[438] This approach has especially come under criticism during a 2022 lockdown on Shanghai, which forced millions to their homes and damaged the city\'s economy,[439] denting the image of Li Qiang, close Xi ally and Party secretary of the city.[440] Conversely, Xi has said that the policy was designed to protect people\'s life safety.[441] On 23 July 2022, the National Health Commission reported that Xi and other top leaders have taken the local COVID-19 vaccines.[442]At the 20th CCP Congress, Xi confirmed the continuation of the zero-COVID policy,[443] stating he would ""unswervingly"" carry out ""dynamic zero-COVID"" and promising to ""resolutely win the battle,""[444] though China started a limited easing of the policies in the following weeks.[445] In November 2022, protests broke out against China\'s COVID-19 policies, with a fire in a high-rise apartment building in Ürümqi being the trigger.[446] The protests were held in multiple major cities, with some of the protesters demanding the end of Xi\'s and the CCP\'s rule.[446] The protests were mostly suppressed by December,[446] though the government further eased COVID-19 restrictions in the time since.[447] On 7 December 2022, China announced large-scale changes to its COVID-19 policy, including allowing quarantine at home for mild infections, reducing of PCR testing, and decreasing the power of local officials to implement lockdowns.[448]Environmental policyIn September 2020, Xi announced that China will ""strengthen its 2030 climate target (NDC), peak emissions before 2030 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060"".[449] If accomplished, this would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2–0.3 °C – ""the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker"".[449] Xi mentioned the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and nature destruction as one of the reasons for the decision, saying that ""Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature.""[450] On 27 September, Chinese scientists presented a detailed plan how to achieve the target.[451] In September 2021, Xi announced that China will not build ""coal-fired power projects abroad, which was said to be potentially ""pivotal"" in reducing emissions. The Belt and Road Initiative did not include financing such projects already in the first half of 2021.[452]Xi Jinping did not attend COP26 personally. However, a Chinese delegation led by climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua did attend.[453][454] During the conference, the United States and China agreed on a framework to reduce GHG emission by co-operating on different measures.[455]Governance styleKnown as a very secretive leader, little is known publicly about how Xi makes political decisions, or how he came to power.[456][457] Xi\'s speeches generally get released months or years after they are made.[456] Xi has also never given a press conference since becoming paramount leader, except in rare joint press conferences with foreign leaders.[456][458] The Wall Street Journal reported that Xi prefers micromanaging in governance, in contrast to previous leaders such as Hu Jintao who left details of major policies to lower-ranking officials.[82] Reportedly, ministerial officials try to get Xi\'s attention in various ways, with some creating slide shows and audio reports. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Xi created a performance-review system in 2018 to give evaluations on officials on various measures, including loyalty.[82] According to The Economist, Xi\'s orders have generally been vague, leaving lower level officials to interpret his words.[428] Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency said that Xi ""personally reviews every draft of major policy documents"" and ""all reports submitted to him, no matter how late in the evening, were returned with instructions the following morning"".[459] With regard to behavior of Communist Party members, Xi emphasizes the ""Two Musts"" (members must not be arrogant or rash and must keep their hard-working spirit) and the ""Six Nos"" (members must say no to formalism, bureaucracy, gift-giving, luxurious birthday celebrations, hedonism, and extravagance).[173]: 52 Xi called for officials to practice self-criticism which, according to observers, is in order to appear less corrupt and more popular among the people.[460][461][462]Political positionsChinese DreamXi and CCP ideologues coined the phrase ""Chinese Dream"" to describe his overarching plans for China as its leader. Xi first used the phrase during a high-profile visit to the National Museum of China on 29 November 2012, where he and his Standing Committee colleagues were attending a ""national revival"" exhibition. Since then, the phrase has become the signature political slogan of the Xi era.[463][464] The origin of the term ""Chinese Dream"" is unclear. While the phrase has been used before by journalists and scholars,[465] some publications have posited the term likely drew its inspiration from the concept of the American Dream.[466] The Economist noted the abstract and seemingly accessible nature of the concept with no specific overarching policy stipulations may be a deliberate departure from the jargon-heavy ideologies of his predecessors.[467] Xi has linked the ""Chinese Dream"" with the phrase ""great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"".[468][e]Cultural revivalIn recent years, top political leaders of the CCP such as Xi have overseen the rehabilitation of ancient Chinese philosophical figures like Han Fei into the mainstream of Chinese thought alongside Confucianism. At a meeting with other officials in 2013, he quoted Confucius, saying ""he who rules by virtue is like the Pole Star, it maintains its place, and the multitude of stars pay homage."" While visiting Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius, in November, he told scholars that the Western world was ""suffering a crisis of confidence"" and that the CCP has been ""the loyal inheritor and promoter of China\'s outstanding traditional culture.""[469]According to several analysts, Xi\'s leadership has been characterised by a resurgence of the ancient political philosophy Legalism.[470][471][472] Han Fei gained new prominence with favourable citations; one sentence of Han Fei\'s that Xi quoted appeared thousands of times in official Chinese media at the local, provincial, and national levels.[472] Xi has additionally supported the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming, telling local leaders to promote him.[473]Xi has also overseen a revival of traditional Chinese culture, breaking from the CCP\'s previous path, which had often attacked it.[474] He has called traditional culture the ""soul"" of the nation and the ""foundation"" of the CCP\'s culture.[475] Xi has also called for integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China\'s traditional culture.[254] Hanfu, the traditional dress of Han Chinese, has seen a revival under him, associated with the revival of traditional culture.[476] He has established the ""four matters of confidence"", which has later been added to the CCP constitution, calling for CCP members, government officials and the Chinese people to be ""confident in our chosen path, confident in our guiding theories, confident in our political system, and confident in our culture"". He has unveiled Global Civilisation initiative in 2023, calling for ""respecting the diversity of civilisations, advocating the common values of humanity, valuing the inheritance and innovation of civilisations, and strengthening international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation""[254]IdeologyXi has said that ""only socialism can save China"".[477] Xi has also declared Deng Xiaoping\'s socialism with Chinese characteristics to be the ""only correct path to realize national rejuvenation"".[478] According to BBC News, while the CCP was perceived to have abandoned its communist ideology since it initiated economic reforms in the 1970s, Xi is believed by some observers to be more believing in the ""idea of a communist project"",[479] being described as a Marxist–Leninist by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd.[480] Xi\'s emphasis on prioritizing ideology has included re-asserting the eventual realization of communism as the Party\'s goal and reprimanding those who dismiss communism as impractical or irrelevant.[161] Xi described the communist ideal as the ""calcium"" in a Party member\'s spine, without which the Party member would suffer the ""osteoporosis"" of political decay and be unable to stand upright.[161]Subscribing to the view that socialism will eventually triumph over capitalism, Xi has said ""Marx and Engels\'s analysis of the basic contradictions of capitalist society is not outdated, nor is the historical materialist view that capitalism is bound to die out and socialism bound to win"".[481] Xi has overseen the increase of ""Socialist Political Economy With Chinese Characteristics"" as a major study topic for academics in China, aiming to decrease the influence of Western-influenced economics.[481] Though he has called a stop to what he considers to be ""disorderly expansion of capital"", he has also said that ""it is necessary to stimulate the vitality of capital of all types, including nonpublic capital, and give full play to its positive role"".[481]China\'s success proves that socialism is not dead. It is thriving. Just imagine this: had socialism failed in China, had our communist party collapsed like the party in the Soviet Union, then global socialism would lapse into a long dark age. And communism, like Karl Marx once said, would be a haunting spectre lingering in limbo.— Xi Jinping during a speech in 2018[482]Xi has supported greater CCP control over the PRC, saying ""government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west – the party leads them all"".[483] During the 100th anniversary of the CCP in 2021, he said that ""without the Communist Party of China, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation"", and that ""the leadership of the Party is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and constitutes the greatest strength of this system"".[484] He has said that China, despite many setbacks, has achieved great progress under the CCP, saying that ""socialism with Chinese characteristics has become the standard-bearer of 21st-century socialist development"".[482] However, he has also warned that it will take a long time for China under the CCP to complete its rejuvenation, and during this timeframe, party members must be vigilant to not let CCP rule collapse.[482]Xi has ruled out a multi-party system for China, saying that ""constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, we considered them, tried them, but none worked"".[485] However, Xi considers China to be a democracy, saying that ""China\'s socialist democracy is the most comprehensive, genuine and effective democracy"".[486] China\'s definition of democracy is different from liberal democracies and is rooted in Marxism–Leninism, and is based on the phrases ""people\'s democratic dictatorship"" and ""democratic centralism"".[486] Xi has additionally coined the term ""whole-process people\'s democracy"" which he said was about having ""the people as masters"".[487] Foreign analysts and observers have widely disputed that China is a democracy, saying that it is a one-party authoritarian state and Xi an authoritarian leader.[494] Some observers, including German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock,[495] have called Xi a dictator, citing the large centralisation of power around him unseen compared to his predecessors.[496][497] Xi has additionally rejected Westernisation as the only way to modernize, instead promoting what he says is ""Chinese-style modernisation"".[498] He has identified five concepts as part of Chinese-style modernisation, including modernisation of a huge population, common prosperity, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development.[499]Xi Jinping ThoughtIn September 2017, the CCP Central Committee decided that Xi\'s political philosophies, generally referred to as ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"", would become part of the Party Constitution.[500][501] Xi first made mention of the ""Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"" in his opening day speech delivered to the 19th Party Congress in October 2017. His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, in their own reviews of Xi\'s keynote address at the Congress, prepended the name ""Xi Jinping"" in front of ""Thought"".[502] On 24 October 2017, at its closing session, the 19th Party Congress approved the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought into the Constitution of the CCP,[102] while in March 2018, the National People\'s Congress changed the state constitution to include Xi Jinping Thought.[503]Xi himself has described the Thought as part of the broad framework created around socialism with Chinese characteristics, a term coined by Deng Xiaoping that places China in the primary stage of socialism. In official party documentation and pronouncements by Xi\'s colleagues, the Thought is said to be a continuation of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, as part of a series of guiding ideologies that embody ""Marxism adopted to Chinese conditions"" and contemporary considerations.[502] It has additionally been described as the ""21st century Marxism"" by two professors in the Central Party School of the CCP.[16] Wang Huning, a top political adviser and a close ally of Xi, has been described as pivotal to developing Xi Jinping Thought.[16] The concepts and context behind Xi Jinping Thought are elaborated in Xi\'s The Governance of China book series, published by the Foreign Languages Press for an international audience. Volume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.[504]An app for teaching Xi Jinping Thought had become the most popular smartphone app in China in 2019, as the country\'s ruling CCP launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse themselves in the political doctrine every day. Xuexi Qiangguo is now the most downloaded item on Apple\'s domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok.[505] In 2021, the government included Xi Jinping Thought in the curriculum including to students from primary schools to university, which created pushback from parents. For much of the preceding 30 years, political ideology and communist doctrine were not a standard taught in Chinese schools until middle school, and textbooks featured a wider set of Chinese leaders with less emphasis on a single leader like Xi.[506]Personal lifeFamilyXi\'s first marriage was to Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China\'s ambassador to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. They divorced within a few years.[507] The two were said to fight ""almost every day"", and after the divorce Ke moved to England.[8] In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan.[508] Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques.[509] Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China\'s ""first lady"" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.[510]Xi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015. While at Harvard, she used a pseudonym and studied Psychology and English.[511] Xi\'s family has a home in Jade Spring Hill, a garden and residential area in north-western Beijing run by the CMC.[512]In June 2012, Bloomberg News reported that members of Xi\'s extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them.[513] The Bloomberg website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article.[514] Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, The New York Times reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012.[515] Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the CCP, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui,[516] Xi\'s brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.[517]PersonalityPeng described Xi as hardworking and down-to-earth: ""When he comes home, I\'ve never felt as if there\'s some leader in the house. In my eyes, he\'s just my husband.""[518] In 1992, The Washington Post journalist Lena H. Sun had an interview with Xi, then CCP secretary of Fuzhou; Sun described Xi as considerably more at ease and confident than many officials his age, and said that he talked without consulting notes.[519] He was described in a 2011 The Washington Post article by those who know him as ""pragmatic, serious, cautious, hard-working, down to earth and low-key"". He was described as a good hand at problem solving and ""seemingly uninterested in the trappings of high office"".[520]Public lifeIt is hard to gauge the opinion of the Chinese public on Xi, as no independent surveys exist in China and social media is heavily censored.[521] However, he is believed to be widely popular in the country.[522][523] According to a 2014 poll co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School\'s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Xi ranked 9 out of 10 in domestic approval ratings.[524] A YouGov poll released in July 2019 found that about 22% of people in mainland China list Xi as the person they admire the most, a plurality, although this figure was less than 5% for residents of Hong Kong.[525] In the spring of 2019, the Pew Research Center made a survey on confidence on Xi Jinping among six-country medians based on Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and South Korea, which indicated that a median 29% have confidence in Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs, meanwhile a median of 45% have no confidence; these numbers are slightly higher than those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (23% confidence, 53% no confidence).[526] A poll by Politico and Morning Consult in 2021 found that 5% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Xi, 38% unfavorable, 17% no opinion and 40%, a plurality, never hearing of him.[527]In 2017, The Economist named him the most powerful person in the world.[528] In 2018, Forbes ranked him as the most powerful and influential person in the world, replacing Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been ranked so for five consecutive years.[529] Since 2013, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Xi among the list of press freedom predators.[530]Unlike previous Chinese leaders, Chinese state media has given a more encompassing view of Xi\'s private life, although still strictly controlled. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi would swim one kilometer and walk every day as long as there was time, and is interested in foreign writers, especially Russian.[459] He is known to love films and TV shows such as Saving Private Ryan, The Departed, The Godfather and Game of Thrones,[531][532][533] also praising the independent film-maker Jia Zhangke.[534] The Chinese state media has also cast him as a fatherly figure and a man of the people, determined to stand up for Chinese interests.[457]Honors|Decoration|Country/Organisation|Date|Note|Ref.|The Golden Olympic Order|International Olympic Committee|19 November 2013|The highest award of the Olympic movement|[535]|Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold|Belgium|30 March 2014|The highest order of Belgium|[536]|Grand Cordon of the Order of the Liberator|Venezuela|20 July 2014|The highest order of Venezuela|[537]|Order of José Martí|Cuba|22 July 2014|Order of Cuba|[538]|Nishan-e-Pakistan|Pakistan|21 April 2015|The highest civilian award of Pakistan|[539]|Order of Abdulaziz al Saud|Saudi Arabia|19 January 2016|Saudi Arabian order of merit|[540]|Collar of the Order of the Republic of Serbia|Serbia|18 June 2016|The highest state order of Serbia|[541]|Order for Promotion of Peace and Friendship|Belarus|29 September 2016|Order of Belarus|[542]|Grand Cross Medal of Honor|Peru|21 November 2016|Medal of Peru|[543]|Order of Saint Andrew|Russia|3 July 2017|The highest order of Russia|[544]|Grand Collar of the State of Palestine|Palestine|18 July 2017|The highest civilian order of Palestine|[545]|Order of Zayed|United Arab Emirates|20 July 2018|The highest civilian decoration of the United Arab Emirates|[546]|Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion|Senegal|29 July 2018|Order of Senegal|[547]|Collar of the Order of the Liberator General San Martin|Argentina|2 December 2018|Order of Argentina|[548]|Order of Manas|Kyrgyzstan|13 June 2019|The highest order of Kyrgyzstan|[549]|Order of the Crown|Tajikistan|15 June 2019|Order of Tajikistan|[550]|Order of the Golden Eagle|Kazakhstan|14 September 2022|The highest order of Kazakhstan|[551]|Order of Friendship|Uzbekistan|15 September 2022|State award of Uzbekistan|[552]|Order of South Africa|South Africa|22 August 2023|State award of South Africa|[553]Key to the CityXi holds a ""key to the city"", an honor granted to attending guests to symbolize their significance, in:- Muscatine, Iowa, United States (26 April 1985)[554][555]- Montego Bay, Jamaica (13 February 2009)[48]- Muscatine, Iowa, United States (14 February 2012)[554]- San José, Costa Rica (3 June 2013)[556]- Mexico City, Mexico (5 June 2013)[557]- Buenos Aires, Argentina (19 July 2014)[558]- Prague, Czech Republic (29 March 2016)[559]- Madrid, Spain (28 November 2018)[560]Honorary doctorates- Nazarbayev University (7 September 2013)[561]- University of Johannesburg (11 April 2019)[562]- Saint Petersburg State University (6 June 2019)[563]- King Saud University (8 December 2022)[564]Works- Xi, Jinping (1999).

Xi has also served as the president of the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) since 2013. He belongs to the fifth generation of Chinese leadership.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, Xi was exiled to rural Yanchuan County as a teenager following his father\'s purge during the Cultural Revolution. He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China\'s coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as Hu Jintao\'s presumed successor as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed vice president of the PRC and vice chairman of the CMC. He officially received the title of leadership core from the CCP in 2016.\n\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China\'s relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China\'s African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. He has also promoted ""common prosperity"", a series of policies designed with stated goal to increase equality, and used the term to justify a broad crackdown and major slew of regulations against the tech and tutoring sectors in 2021. Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, the first time PRC and Republic of China leaders met, though relations deteriorated after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016. He responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China with a zero-COVID approach from January 2020 until December 2022, afterwards shifting towards a mitigation strategy. Xi also oversaw the passage of a national security law in Hong Kong, clamping down on political opposition in the city, especially pro-democracy activists.\n\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi\'s tenure has included an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights, including the internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang (which some observers have described as part of a genocide), a cult of personality developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi\'s political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. He and the CCP Central Committee passed a ""historical resolution"" in November 2021, the third such resolution after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to do so.\n\nEarly life and education\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi\'s father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People\'s Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An\'an (安安; Ān\'ān), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi\'s father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6]Xi went to the Beijing Bayi School,[7][8] and then the Beijing No. 25 School,[9] in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China\'s vice premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China\'s paramount leader.[10][11] In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[12] In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi\'s secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi\'s sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.[13]Later, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen\'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan\'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong\'s Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n'}, {'raw_text': 'Xi Jinping is China’s political leader, but what does that mean in practice? Yuhua Wang, professor of government at Harvard University, analyzes Xi’s status in the Chinese political system and how much influence he has.Listen to more U.S.-China Insights podcastsSpeaker BioYuhua Wang is the Frederick S. Danziger Associate Professor in the Department of Government at Harvard University. He is the author of Tying the Autocrat’s Hands: The Rise of the Rule of Law in China (Cambridge University Press, 2015) and The Rise and Fall of Imperial China: The Social Origins of State Development (Princeton University Press, 2022).TranscriptWho is Xi Jinping?Yuhua Wang: So Xi Jinping is the political leader of China. Among all the positions he’s holding, he’s probably holding dozens of positions right now, but there are three that are the most important.First, he’s the president of China. This means that he’s the head of the state. He gets to meet with other heads of state, for example, Queen Elizabeth or the President of the United States. But in China, this is a symbolic position, which doesn’t come with a lot of power.Second, he’s the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. This means that he’s the boss of the party. This is more powerful than for example, his counterpart in the U.S., which for example, is the chairman of the Republican National Committee, which doesn’t have a lot of power, but in China, if you’re the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, you get to make decisions not only for the party but also for the whole country.The third thing, which is the most powerful among all, is the chairman of the Central Military Affairs Commission. This means that he’s the commander in chief in China, who is in charge of China’s military. In addition to these formal positions, he’s also a princeling, which means that he’s the son of one of the founding fathers of the People’s Republic of China. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a colleague of Mao Zedong’s and also a high-ranking official in the 1950s, 1960s. So Xi Jinping has this formal power coming from his formal positions, but also, he has this charisma, this legacy from his father who was one of the founders.How much power does Xi Jinping have?Yuhua Wang: So a popular view is that Xi is a dictator who moves his fingers and things get done in China, but that’s just not true. I’m going to make a bold argument here that he’s actually not as powerful as we think he is. You know, we often associate power with formal positions, but that has not been the case in Chinese politics. Deng Xiaoping for example, who was the leader of China in the 1980s, didn’t hold the same positions that Xi Jinping is holding. For example, Deng was never the president of China, Deng was never the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. So you cannot really measure how much power a person has by looking at his formal positions.You know, we political scientists often consider power to have three faces. We have three faces of power. The first is decision making power. So who gets to make decisions for example, how much money we should allocate to infrastructure rather than education, things like that. The second phase of power is so-called agenda-setting power. That is, you know you get to decide what decisions get to make. For example, you know, during a meeting, what are the items on the agenda that we can make decisions on? This is the second face of power. If you can make the agenda, you have a lot of power. But then the really important face of power, which is the third face of power, is about solid control, that is you can influence how people think. And then if you have this face of power, you have the third face of power, you can influence how people think. You don’t even need the first two faces of power. You don’t need to make decisions, you don’t need to decide the agenda. You can just simply influence how people think, right? So that’s the most important face of power we political scientists care about.So in a sense, say, for example, a lot of people compare Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping and think that Xi is more powerful than Mao Zedong, but I would make the counter-argument that Mao actually has the third face of power, that during the Cultural Revolution, during the whole Mao era, I would say Mao could really influence how Chinese people think. You know, during the Cultural Revolution, people followed him, you know, voluntarily, you know, to become Red Guards, for example. And people were voluntarily doing this, not because of fear. It’s actually because they believed in Mao, they believed in Maoism. They believed that Mao is a good leader who can lead China to a better future.But, you know, I would say that Xi Jinping doesn’t have that power. I think most of the times in contemporary China, Xi makes people comply by creating fear. It’s not that people are following him voluntarily, it’s actually that people are following him because people worry about the risks of not following him. And then say, for example, during his anti-corruption campaign, he arrested a lot of high-ranking officials, which created this fear among all the bureaucrats in the whole political system. And then people, you know, changed their behavior because of fear created during the anti-corruption campaign, not because people voluntarily follow what Xi Jinping tells them to do. And it might have reduced corruption in the Chinese government, but we don’t really know whether it will last once the fear is gone.And then one limitation of using fear is that you never know whether people are truly loyal to you. They are now loyal to you on the surface. Xi appears to have no political opponents, at least publicly, but the officials all appear to be loyal and compliant, but they might be hiding their true feelings. So I think it’s very important to understand it is not only about, you know, how you look on the surface or how powerful you are, whether you can make decisions, it’s also about whether you can shape how people think.Talking about the three faces of power, how much do we know about whether Xi as an individual has this power, or whether this is a coalition? How much do we know about his individual power?Yuhua Wang: Well, the truth is we don’t know much. You know, this is inside politics within the Chinese Communist Party, it’s not very transparent. But I guess one thing I can say is Xi is very special among all the Chinese leaders or recent top leaders in the sense that he didn’t have his coalition before he became the top leader of China. You know, he was working at a local level for a long period of time before he got promoted to Beijing. And then he really built his coalition after he became the top leader of China in 2012. And then he was able to promote a lot of his colleagues from the places he worked before. So he didn’t have this coalition before, but then he was able to build this coalition after he became the top leader. So I would say that his individual power certainly outweighs the power from his coalition in this sense.You already mentioned political opponents, but when we’re thinking about building a coalition, there’s an in-group, and then by definition, there has to be an out-group. So does he perhaps not have political opponents, but is there room for difference of thought underneath Xi, or is there a diversity of political groups, if not formal parties?Yuhua Wang: One of the things that he has been trying to do since 2012 is he has been trying to eliminate or weaken the outside groups. You know, for example, one of the goals of the anti-corruption campaign is to weaken so-called factions that are not loyal to himself. He’s trying to build his own faction, but also he’s trying to make everyone his own faction. So I think that’s one of his goals of governing China since 2012. So there might be opponents within the Chinese political system, there might be disagreements, but we just don’t get to hear them because of the reason that I said. There’s this fear within the Chinese political system that everybody doesn’t dare to speak out when they disagree with Xi. I think that’s very dangerous for the ruler because as the ruler of a country, you want to hear what people are really thinking so that you know who are your enemies, who are your friends, but when everybody becomes quiet and then they comply, I think it’s very dangerous for the top leader.What is a sign that there might be a potential shift in the balance of power? How would that manifest in terms of policy or how the country is being governed?Yuhua Wang: I don’t think there will be a big event that leads to the collapse of the Chinese Communist Party. I don’t think that that will happen in the near future, but I think that in the next let’s say 5 or 10 years, if Xi Jinping is still in power, let’s say, in the next 5 or 10 years, one sign that his power is declining is we see more policy changes or policy shifts within a very short period of time. We’ve heard in the past several years that Xi has been trying to push for certain policies, but you know, we are, maybe in the next 5 or 10 years, likely to see some policies, there’s some new policies that change his policies, where there are some public discussions that question the policies that Xi made in the past 10 years. So I think those are probably the signs that his power is declining, also a sign that there are disagreements within the party, but that’s still very unlikely, I think, because Xi has accumulated so much power within the Chinese Communist Party. And then, like I said, everybody is quiet because there’s fear.What about a political leader like Kim Jong-un or Vladimir Putin? These are also leaders whom Americans think of as dictators, in a broad sense. How would you disaggregate these three figures from this single definition?Yuhua Wang: One difference between Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un is that Kim Jong-un’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, created the Workers’ Party of Korea. This is the ruling party in North Korea right now. This means that the legitimacy of the Kim family predated the legitimacy of the ruling party in Korea. And then you can imagine that, for example, if the Kim family is gone, North Korea might collapse because the whole legitimacy of the regime really depends on the legitimacy of the Kim family. But this is not the case for Xi Jinping or the Chinese Communist Party. Xi’s family even though his father was one of the founding fathers of the People’s Republic of China, but he didn’t create the party like Kim II-sung did, so, therefore, the power of the Xi family or the power of Xi Jinping himself really comes from the party. The party has the legitimacy. People support the party, and then they support whoever controls the party. Say, for example, if Xi Jinping is gone, or the Xi family is gone, I would imagine that the Chinese Communist Party will still be there, you know, in China, you know, ruling China because the legitimacy of the party is still active without Xi Jinping himself.And then when it comes to Putin, it’s very interesting that both are, in the popular view, both are dictators who have a lot of power, but actually, if you look at what they did, they both followed the rules. In Putin’s case, he had to step down because the constitution had term limits. He had to step down to become the prime minister and then he comes back to become the president. For Xi Jinping, because the constitution has term limits for the presidency, he had to change the constitution. This is also a manifestation of power, but then he had to follow the rules. He had to change the constitution so that he can follow the rules. When he abolished the term limits, now he can rule forever. Some of them actually follow the rules, so that’s very interesting, which is very counterintuitive when we think about them as powerful dictators.You mentioned term limits. Will Xi Jinping rule for life?Yuhua Wang: He can rule for life, but it doesn’t mean that he will. If I were Xi Jinping–I would never become Xi Jinping–but if I were the top leader in China and then there’s no term limits, the best way for me and for my legacies to continue is actually when I’m healthy, when I’m relatively younger, I would choose someone that I trust completely and then make that person my heir apparent, and then make sure that he or she, I hope it’s a she, but it’s not very likely in Chinese politics, my heir apparent will carry my legacies. So I think that would be the best scenario for Xi Jinping. Which means that if he really cares about his legacies, he’ll step down earlier and then choose his heir apparent to make sure that the heir apparent will continue his policies.', 'url': 'https://www.ncuscr.org/podcast/how-powerful-is-xi-jinping/', 'cleaned_text': ""Xi Jinping is China’s political leader, holding several important positions. He is the president of China, which is a symbolic position with limited power. He is also the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, which gives him significant decision-making power for both the party and the country. Additionally, he serves as the chairman of the Central Military Affairs Commission, making him the commander in chief of China's military. Apart from his formal positions, Xi Jinping is a princeling, being the son of one of the founding fathers of the People’s Republic of China. However, despite his formal power, his actual influence may not be as strong as perceived. Power in Chinese politics is not solely determined by formal positions. There are three faces of power: decision-making power, agenda-setting power, and solid control, which is the ability to influence how people think. While Xi Jinping may have decision-making and agenda-setting power, his solid control over the Chinese people is questionable. Unlike Mao Zedong, who had the ability to shape how people think, Xi Jinping often relies on fear to make people comply. His anti-corruption campaign, for example, created fear among bureaucrats, leading to changed behavior. However, this fear-based approach may not result in true loyalty. It is difficult to determine the extent of Xi Jinping's individual power versus the power of his coalition within the Chinese Communist Party. He built his coalition after becoming the top leader of China, promoting colleagues from his previous positions. Xi Jinping has been working to eliminate or weaken outside groups and factions that are not loyal to him, aiming to make everyone part of his own faction. While there may be opponents and disagreements within the Chinese political system, they are not openly expressed.\n\n""}, {'raw_text': 'After Mao Zedong died, Deng Xiaoping and his colleagues sought to prevent “the overconcentration of power” by introducing fixed terms of office, term limits, and a mandatory retirement age; delegating authority from the Communist Party to government agencies; and holding regular meetings of Party institutions. All these moves were designed to decentralize authority, regularize political life and check dictatorial power. The centerpiece of the institutionalization project was the practice of regular peaceful leadership succession followed by Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Regular premortem leadership succession was a rare achievement in a communist system and the most important source of China’s “authoritarian resilience.” Yet today, Xi Jinping is taking China back to a personalistic dictatorship after decades of institutionalized collective leadership. He has clearly signaled his intention to remain in office after his normal two terms end in 2022. This article analyzes the reasons why the institutional rules and precedents laid down since Deng Xiaoping’s time failed to prevent the emergence of another strongman leader like Mao Zedong.After Mao Zedong died at the age of 82 in 1976, his successors deliberately crafted a system that they hoped would prevent the rise of another dictator. Mao had turned against other leaders and put the nation at risk through irrational schemes. Deng Xiaoping, Mao’s former comrade-in-arms who had twice been purged by him, did not blame Mao as an individual for the tragic mistakes of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) and the Great Leap Forward (1958–62). Instead, Deng targeted the systemic source of the problem: “Over-concentration of power is liable to give rise to arbitrary rule by individuals at the expense of collective leadership.”1Deng and his colleagues introduced fixed terms of office, term limits, and a mandatory retirement age; delegated authority from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to government agencies under the State Council (the cabinet of the People’s Republic of China [PRC]); and started holding regular meetings of CCP institutions such as the Central Committee as well as the Politburo and its Standing Committee (the inner rings of power). All these moves were meant to decentralize authority, regularize political life, and check dictatorial power.The centerpiece of the effort to prevent dictatorship and regularize political competition was the practice of peaceful leadership succession. Students of authoritarianism often identify leadership succession as its “Achilles heel”—a weak point that threatens regime stability by breeding power struggles and sclerotic leadership. When Jiang Zemin voluntarily retired from the post of CCP general secretary in 2002 (followed by his stepping down as president in 2003 and military chief in 2004), [End Page 22] it was the first time that any ruler of a communist nation had left office without dying or being deposed by a coup. After Jiang, Hu Jintao served ten years in the three top offices, then voluntarily retired from all those positions in 2012 and 2013. Peaceful and regular premortem leadership succession has been a remarkable political achievement and the most important source of what Andrew Nathan has called China’s “authoritarian resilience.”2Yet today, after decades of collective leadership, Xi Jinping is taking China back to personalistic leadership. By the end of his first five-year term, Xi had consolidated greater personal power than Jiang or Hu had ever held. Xi broke precedent by not promoting a successor-in-training at the Nineteenth Party Congress in October 2017. And in March 2018 the National People’s Congress (or NPC, China’s legislature) changed the state constitution to abolish the two-term limit for the president—a clear sign that Xi is planning to stay on beyond 2023.China in the twenty-first century is a vibrant modern economy and society open to the world, with a large and well-educated urban middle class. Many people inside and outside the country expected its political system to follow the historical example of other authoritarian regimes by gradually institutionalizing governance to make it more accountable, responsive, and law-bound. Until 2012, that is essentially what happened. But under Xi Jinping, China is making a U-turn. Personalistic rule is back.Why have the institutional rules and precedents laid down since Deng Xiaoping’s time failed to prevent the rise of another Mao-like strongman, with all the risks that implies? In institutionalizing collective leadership after Mao, the CCP was taking the path followed earlier by communist parties in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.3 Those parties adapted to suit the needs of economic and social modernization, but in the end they lost power and today are no more. Xi Jinping is determined to avert such a fate for the CCP, so he has turned in the opposite direction. His unexpected reversion to strongman rule suggests that the change from personalism to institutionalized collective leadership in authoritarian regimes is cyclical, not evolutionary.Xi Jinping has grasped all the levers of power in the Party and the state (including the military and police). The Party has reclaimed the authority over economic policy that it delegated to the state starting in the 1980s. Echoing vintage-1962 Mao, the 2017 Party Congress declared that “East-West North-South the Party is leading everything.” The Leading Small Group on Comprehensively Deepening Reform, chaired by Xi with three other Politburo Standing Committee members as vice chairs, has become a more powerful shadow State Council, usually meeting monthly and issuing specific policies on a wide range of issues, including economic ones.4 Heads of government bodies now regularly report to the Politburo Standing Committee. [End Page 23]Within the Party, Xi acts as if he is personally in charge of everything. He chairs eight of the leading small groups including the National Security Commission. Xi also handles internal security directly, thereby reducing the chances of a coup.Xi’s hold on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is even more complete than his hold on the CCP and the government. As Tai Ming Cheung has observed, “No other Chinese Communist Party leader, not even Mao Zedong, has controlled the military to the same extent as Xi does today. Mao had to share power with powerful revolutionary-era marshals.”5 To show how “hands-on” he is, Xi has taken the new post of commander-in-chief of the PLA Joint Battle Command. One officer told me that whereas generals administered the PLA under Hu, Xi runs it himself. The People’s Armed Police, responsible for putting down civil unrest, used to be under the joint control of the CCP Central Military Commission and the State Council. Now the Military Commission, headed by Xi, has sole charge of China’s paramilitary police.Xi’s first term saw an unprecedented campaign against official corruption and Party indiscipline. Through this crackdown he cleaned up the CCP—and purged his rivals. As of late 2017, the CCP Central Discipline Commission had punished almost 1.4 million Party members. They included seventeen full and seventeen alternate Central Committee members, a pair of sitting Politburo members, an ex-member of the Politburo Standing Committee, and more than a hundred generals and admirals. The main goal, said Xi, was to restore public respect for the Party. It was a matter of “survival or extinction.”6 Xi has also begun using the Discipline Commission against local officials who fail to carry out top-down economic and environmental policies. As of 2018, a new body under Xi’s de facto control called the National Supervision Commission will press the campaign beyond Party members to everyone who works for the state or its affiliates. This will include professors, doctors, and executives of state-owned enterprises.The crackdown gave Xi weapons to eliminate potential rivals, erase competing power centers, and enforce through fear the absolute loyalty of the political elite to the CCP and to himself. When it comes to sharing power with other Party leaders, the contrast between Xi and his predecessor Hu Jintao could not be more striking. Hu let senior CCP figures govern their own policy domains and build their own patronage networks. Xi Jinping has been systematically demolishing the organizational bases for patronage networks controlled by others.During his first term, Xi used the Discipline Commission to purge six powerful leaders for alleged coup attempts. Without giving details, he publicly charged them with plotting to seize power through “anti-Party activity.” Those who went down included not only former security czar and Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang but also Politburo member Bo Xilai, former top Hu aide Ling Jihua, senior [End Page 24] generals Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, and Sun Zhengcai, a Politburo member and potential successor who was purged just before the Party Congress in October 2017.Xi Jinping is preoccupied with shoring up loyalty to the Party and himself. Despite his apparent grip on power, his insecurity is glaring. In a January 2018 speech, Xi called on all officials to remain loyal to the Party “at any time, and under any circumstance.”7 He has revived Mao’s practice of requiring all Party officials, including major provincial leaders and the Politburo, to engage in criticism and self-criticism and pledge loyalty (biaotai) to the Party’s central apparatus and to his position as its core.8 These rituals serve not only to flatter Xi, but also to impede other politicians from organizing collectively against his rule. Party members in general are told to shun any “improper discussion” (wangyi) that questions central policies,9 and the recruitment of new members now requires stricter loyalty standards. The overriding concerns are with reinforcing Xi’s authority and keeping the Party in line behind him.A documentary about the fall of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) that all CCP members are required to watch makes clear that Xi fears the political elite more than the masses. According to the film, even as the Soviet public continued overwhelmingly to support the CPSU, corrupt and ideologically confused leaders such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin destroyed it from the top down.10Xi has also turned left ideologically, striking fear into intellectuals, journalists, and private businesspeople. Since 2013, the CCP has officially banned media and classroom discussion of seven topics associated with Western values that are considered subversive: universalism, press freedom, judicial independence, civil society, citizens’ rights, the historical mistakes of the Party, and cronyism within elite financial and political circles.11 University professors who are Party members must defend the CCP in class if anyone criticizes it. Western textbooks are banned and being replaced with new indigenous versions that emphasize Marxism.At all levels of schooling, more time is now being devoted to mandatory politics courses. Schools of Marxism are enjoying a renaissance on campuses all over the country. “Virtuocracy” has returned; getting ahead at school and work again depends at least in part on one’s “redness.”12 Public intellectuals with popular blogs have faced arrest, and some of them have been forced to make humiliating televised confessions [End Page 25] that call to mind the Cultural Revolution. Xi, meanwhile, gives speeches promoting a rosy view of the Mao era that no one outside the hard-left fringes has voiced in thirty years.Under Xi, the CCP’s stability-maintenance machine has become more efficient and more totalitarian. Censorship was once fragmented across agencies, with cracks that nimble journalists and netizens could exploit to circulate information. Now the censors are more consolidated and centralized. A potent new Cyber Administration, run by a leading small group that Xi chairs, aims to win what the general secretary calls the “struggle for public opinion.”Editors of online news sites report that censorship has become more granular and efficient. The censors have hounded critical voices off Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, and are now showing the ability to penetrate circles of friends who message one another on WeChat. Getting around the Great Firewall to access foreign media has become harder than ever. As a result of the near-total control over information not only would large-scale protests be more difficult to organize, but also any potential rivals to Xi would find it tougher to gather a mass following.Efforts to promote CCP propaganda have intensified. Xi has called for the arts, media, and internet to strengthen popular support for the Party. In 2016, he visited the three main official news organizations (Xinhua, People’s Daily, and CCTV) to ask journalists to pledge loyalty to the Party and to him. He demanded that “official media make the Party their surname,” and insisted that they “strictly adhere to the news viewpoint of Marxism” and “rebuild people’s trust in the Party”—two requirements that may be mutually contradictory.13Xi has also been tightening the Party’s centralized social control through law. The Party has always managed the courts, but now central or provincial CCP authorities—not local Party figures—appoint judges. Sweeping new laws reinforce the Party’s power over domestic and foreign NGOs, national security, and cybersecurity. In July 2015, about three-hundred lawyers whose only crime was helping citizens to defend their rights under existing Chinese law were detained on charges of “subverting state power.” This is not the rule of law that Chinese reformers once envisioned. Instead, it is Communist Party rule by law.By the end of his first term, Xi had consolidated greater personal authority than Jiang or Hu had ever held. Xi was anointed the “core” of the Party leadership, a title that Deng had given to Jiang Zemin but was never granted to Hu Jintao. Xi’s personal contribution to Party ideology, “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era,” was incorporated in the CCP constitution during his time in office, an honor accorded to no one since Mao. After obsequious officials started calling him the great “Leader” (lingxiu), an appellation associated [End Page 26] with Mao, the Politburo picked it up, calling Xi a Leader “loved and esteemed by the people.”14Official media overflow with articles extolling Xi’s virtues and putting him on a level with Mao and Deng. Often repeated is the saying, “Under Mao the Chinese people stood up (zhanqilai); under Deng the Chinese people got rich (fuqilai); and under Xi the Chinese people are becoming stronger (qiangqilai).” Jiang and Hu, meanwhile, have become invisible. The Xi personality cult is gathering steam as Xi seeks, in the words of historian Rana Mitter, to “centralize as much authority and charisma under his own person” as he can.15The Nineteenth Party CongressThe Nineteenth Party Congress was a stress test of the CCP’s political institutionalization. Would the rules and precedents of collective leadership be able to constrain a leader as ambitious as Xi?The answer, it appears, is both yes and no. Scenarios in which the Congress would become a launch pad to extreme dictatorship failed to materialize. Xi did not emerge from the meeting with Mao’s old title of CCP chairman. And Xi opted to retain the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee rather than get rid of it and rule through the Party Secretariat. The customary retirement age of 68 was strictly applied, even though it required Xi’s close ally and Discipline Commission head Wang Qishan to step down. The Party, State Council, provinces, and military were represented in the Politburo according to the same proportions as in the past.16Continuing the practice followed by each of the four Party Congresses since 1997, the Nineteenth Congress produced a Politburo Standing Committee composed entirely of the most senior members of the Politburo. Xi did see to it that nine of the fifteen new Politburo members were family friends and former colleagues of his, but he did not pack the Politburo Standing Committee with his close allies. The current Standing Committee includes two figures from the Jiang-affiliated Shanghai bureaucracy and two associated with Hu. Xi may hope that sticking to some of the rules and creating a factional balance at the apex of power will shield him against a backlash from CCP elites who resent him for stripping away their patronage powers and jeopardizing their security.Xi may need shielding, for the Nineteenth Congress openly proclaimed his elevated status. Being called Leader and having “Xi Jinping Thought” written into the CCP constitution fall into this category. The effect only intensified in March 2018, when the NPC similarly amended the constitution of the People’s Republic. Xi’s personal status as the Party’s Leader is the main theme of the propaganda preaching (xuanjiang) on the Nineteenth Congress that is underway in schools and offices throughout the country. [End Page 27]Most significant, however, was Xi’s decision to break with precedent by not appointing a “successor-in-training” to be groomed for the top job. Both Xi himself and Hu Jintao had been picked to assume power five years or more ahead of time. The absence of a chosen successor, and the amending of the state constitution to abolish term limits for the president a few months later, were a shocking declaration of Xi’s intention to rule into the indefinite future. Ignoring Deng Xiaoping’s warnings and flouting the hard-won practice of predictable leadership succession is a bold move that both demonstrates Xi’s power and injects greater uncertainty and tension into the political system.The lack of a successor-in-training makes it unlikely that the precedent of naming a younger leader to the Central Military Commission halfway through the second term will be followed. Xi therefore will remain the only civilian with any authority over the PLA and the People’s Armed Police.The legitimacy of Xi’s leadership within the Party was weakened by the Nineteenth Congress’s move away from nominating leaders on the basis of voting in straw polls. The CCP Central Committee has about two-hundred full members who form the “selectorate” that the CCP constitution authorizes to elect the Party’s top leaders.17 In 2007 and 2012, the Central Committee held straw polls before the formal vote. These informal votes represented a small step toward intraparty democracy, even though the results were kept secret and were only advisory; final nominations were determined by a set of current and retired leaders whose precise composition remains unknown. Still, the straw polls boosted the legitimacy of those chosen while cutting the risk that a nominee would lose the formal vote. Xi Jinping is widely believed to have been chosen as Hu Jintao’s successor because Xi earned more votes than Li Keqiang in the 2007 straw poll.This time, however, Xi sought to keep control over the nomination process by replacing voting with interviews.18 Xi solicited elite opinions in 57 interviews with senior officials, the Politburo Standing Committee members interviewed 258 ministers, and the Military Commission interviewed 32 military officers. Xinhua praised this process as more free, fair, and democratic than the straw polls, which it claimed had been marred by canvassing, haphazard voting, voting based on personal ties, and even bribery. By replacing the straw polls with interviewing by the boss, Xi Jinping further eroded the elite’s confidence in his willingness to share power with them.Why is the CCP heading back to personalistic rule after more than thirty years of institutionalized collective leadership? What has foiled Deng Xiaoping’s plan to prevent the overconcentration of authority? Why are the rules governing leadership competition inadequate to constrain an ambitious leader such as Xi Jinping? I would point to the following six factors: [End Page 28]1) The rules concerning the CCP general secretary’s retirement are unwrittenBy instituting mandatory retirement and terms limits in the Party, the state, and the military, Deng threw open the doors of opportunity to younger officials and gave China a system of brisk elite turnover. Written rules specify retirement ages for government, military, and Party officials at various levels and mandate universal term limits: five years a term, with each official able to serve in the same position for no more than two terms, and the same leadership rank for no more than three terms.19Yet the rules governing leadership turnover at the apex of power within the Party are unwritten. Neither the CCP constitution nor any other document fixes retirement ages or term limits for members of the Central Committee, Politburo, and Politburo Standing Committee, or for the general secretary himself.20The retirement age for Party leaders has been lowered over time as a convenient tactic for eliminating rivals. In 1997, Jiang Zemin got rid of Qiao Shi by making 70 the retirement age for Politburo-level officials, and then exempting himself despite being 71 years old. The Politburo retirement age became 68 in 2002 as a means of forcing the popular Li Ruihuan off the Standing Committee. Since then, 68 has been the consistently observed retirement age, but there is no written rule that makes it so. Hu Jintao’s advisors had hoped that he would write the two-term limit for the Party general secretary into the CCP constitution to match the limit that the PRC constitution imposes on the president, but he never did so. Now that the constitution has been revised to abolish the two-term limit for the president, there is no rule blocking Xi Jinping’s obvious ambition to rule for life.2) Retired leaders still exercise informal influenceDeng Xiaoping sought to strengthen CCP institutions and to make leadership turnovers a regular thing, yet even while relinquishing official posts he remained the de facto preeminent leader until shortly before his death in 1997 from Parkinson’s disease at the age of 92. The influence wielded by a retired senior leader—and especially a former CCP general secretary—although diminished since Deng’s time, remains formidable. Jiang Zemin’s interventions in personnel matters under Hu received blame as a cause of growing high-level corruption in government, the military, and the CCP.Retired leaders also can have a beneficial effect, however. Under term limits, the informal dynamics between the retired and current top leaders, as well as between the current leader and his successor-in-training, can help to check dictatorial tendencies and ease the sharing of power and patronage within the elite. As Beijing University political scientist Xiao Ma puts it, “This evolving bargain over allocation of political power among multiple generations of leaders further keeps any one faction from dominating the others.”21 [End Page 29]But there is no intergenerational bargain constraining Xi Jinping. Jiang Zemin is 91 and hobbled politically by age. Hu Jintao, a far more self-effacing figure than Jiang, stays out of Xi Jinping’s way. Moreover, there is no preappointed successor with whom Xi must share the elite’s loyalty. The constellation of forces in elite politics is severely skewed in Xi’s favor.3) The Tiananmen crisis exerts a lingering effectIn 1989, demonstrators protesting inflation and corruption took to the streets in more than 130 cities across China. The CCP’s leaders split on how to respond. Some urged dialogue to address the protestors’ concerns, while others favored a hard line. The widespread unrest and open divisions at the top drove the political system to the brink of collapse. In the end, CCP rule survived only because the army followed Deng Xiaoping’s orders and used force against the demonstrators.After the crackdown, influential CCP figures including retired leaders blamed the close call on the Party’s having given up too much control through ill-advised delegation and decentralization. They took aim at the separation of the work of government agencies from the Party that had reached a high point in 1987, when a constitutional change eliminated CCP groups within ministries. There had even been talk of trying to create a professional civil service outside the Party’s appointment powers. Following Tiananmen, the Party revised the constitution to restore Party groups within ministries and put state officials on a shorter leash. This reversal smoothed the way for the CCP under Xi to reclaim policy-making authority from the State Council.China’s model of fused leadership, in which a single person serves as general secretary of the CCP, president of the PRC, and chairman of the Central Military Commission, is another product of the Tiananmen crisis. Before 1989, state president had been a mere title, and Deng Xiaoping had run the Military Commission without being CCP general secretary. After the crisis, when Deng picked Shanghai CCP boss Jiang Zemin to succeed cashiered general secretary Zhao Ziyang (put under house arrest for being soft on protesters and overdoing political reforms), Deng gave Jiang the title of “core leader” plus the three top jobs. The idea was to bolster Jiang’s position in the face of political foes who might under-cut him. Contrasting China’s fused leadership with Vietnam’s collective leadership, which divides authority among the Communist Party general secretary, the premier, and the president, highlights the long-lasting centralizing effects of China’s Tiananmen crisis.224) There is no enforcement outside the Chinese Communist PartyEven as he was working to make the CCP and its rule more institutional, Deng Xiaoping had a line he would not cross: “No Western-style separation of powers.”23 This aversion to giving the legislature or courts [End Page 30] authority to check the power of the CCP or its leader meant that the institutionalization project from its outset had a built-in limit.Today, the National People’s Congress passes more legislation—and its lawmakers take their responsibilities more seriously—than before. But China’s national legislature remains under CCP domination. The courts, while offering channels for redress of citizen grievances, still operate under the thumb of Party authorities. The CCP’s central apparatus appoints the members of the NPC Standing Committee and the judges of the Supreme People’s Court. Neither institution has exercised authority over the actions of Party officials.5) Communist parties have an “ambiguity of authority” problemWith no institution outside the CCP able to check the behavior of Party leaders, this duty falls to the collective institutions of the Party, in particular the Central Committee. But the locus of authority within communist parties is difficult to pin down because of the relationship between the top leaders and the Central Committee that I call “reciprocal accountability.”24 China’s political system looks like a hierarchy in which the top CCP leaders name subordinate officials of the CCP, the government, and the military. Yet according to the CCP’s constitution, the Central Committee has formal authority to elect the Politburo, Standing Committee, and general secretary, making the top leaders accountable to a broader political elite. All Central Committee members, however, hold concurrent jobs in the Party, government, or military—and have those jobs by appointment of top Party leaders.The lines of authority and accountability thus flow in both directions, much like the relationship between the pope and the College of Cardinals in the Vatican. The CCP general secretary’s authority, however, is less constrained by reciprocal accountability than that of the pope; the cardinals have voting tenure (that is, they can serve in the conclave that elects a new pope, since 1945 by fully secret ballot) until the fixed retirement age of 80. Members of the CCP Central Committee, by contrast, serve at the pleasure of the general secretary and the Politburo Standing Committee.Over time, the Central Committee’s composition has become more stable. The CCP National Congress, meeting every five years, elects the Central Committee in a ballot that has approximately 8 percent more nominees than the number of seats. The number of seats, although not fixed in writing, has settled at approximately 370: There are 204 full members and 166 alternates. The Central Committee has come to have a rough “job-slot representation,” in which certain jobs such as provincial Party secretary and governor carry Central Committee membership with them.Since 1997, the balance among the main blocs has remained steady at these approximate proportions: provincial officials, 45 percent; central-government officials, 25 percent; officials of the central CCP apparatus, [End Page 31] 18 percent; and the PLA, 10 percent.25 The weight of numbers that provincial politicians enjoy in the Central Committee helps to explain why Beijing often has a hard time implementing policies unfavorable to provincial financial or economic interests. Under reciprocal accountability, these officials are not mere agents of the Party center.The Central Committee’s ability to stop a CCP leader from ruling dictatorially or making policy misjudgments, however, is limited by its unwieldy processes (it lacks a committee structure) and infrequent meetings (in the past five years it has met just seven times). It operates in secret and has no accountability to the public. Given such circumstances, which are common among ruling communist parties, it is hardly surprising that central committees rarely assert their authority. Instead, small groups of executives at the top make all decisions. As Deng noted in 1980, there is a “tradition of a high degree of concentration of power in the hands of individual leaders of communist parties in various countries.”266) There were failures of collective leadership under Hu JintaoPower-sharing under collective leadership may boost the resilience of an authoritarian regime, but it can have its drawbacks. Under Hu, the general secretary was only first among equals; each member of the Politburo Standing Committee had authority over his own policy domain. The design was purposeful. As the 2007 Party Congress communiqué explained, collective leadership was “a system with a division of responsibilities among individual leaders in an effort to prevent arbitrary decision-making by a single top leader.”27 Yet collective leadership led to obvious problems: Policy coordination was poor, corruption was rampant, and dangerous rifts split the leadership. When Xi took over in 2012, both the elite and the public at large welcomed his more forceful leadership.Hu comes in for much criticism within China as a weak figure who never fully escaped Jiang Zemin’s continuing interference. Certainly, Hu’s modest personality inclined him more to collective leadership than to taking charge. But he also was sincerely committed to improving Chinese governance and making collective leadership work. He instituted performance-based promotions, experimented with intra-Party democracy, and studied the Vietnamese model of dividing the highest posts among different leaders rather than having one person fill them all. Yet Hu’s results were disappointing, particularly during his second term: Economic reforms stalled while key domestic and foreign policies suffered from poor coordination and erratic changes of course.The problem was not so much indecisiveness as a failure to rein in the parochial interest groups within the Party, the government, and the military. Hu and the other senior leaders were reluctant to question one another’s actions for fear of opening splits in the oligarchy. Instead, they [End Page 32] achieved consensus through a kind of logrolling process.28 In China, bureaucratic interest groups are “stovepiped”—they exist as separate vertical organizations that reach from Beijing down to the provinces and cities, neither communicating with one another nor inclined to embrace much discipline or coordination from above. Instead, each bureaucracy has its highly placed patron in the Politburo Standing Committee, and pushes for a bigger budget, more staff, and wider influence. As experts on U.S. politics would put it, no one was watching out for the “party label,” that is, the standing of the CCP as a whole.The most conspicuous failure of the Hu era was the massive corruption that this decentralized system allowed high-ranking politicians and military officers to get away with. Official corruption angered the public, which enthusiastically welcomed Xi’s determination to end the dishonest dealings of both “tigers” and “flies.”The leadership split that broke into the open on the eve of Xi’s 2012 ascension to power dramatized the strengthening of centrifugal forces under collective leadership and made the case for a stronger leader to enforce Party unity. Bo Xilai, the Party secretary in Chongqing and a Politburo member, had violated elite norms by building a public following through a combination of economic populism, a highly publicized law-and-order campaign, and nostalgia for the Mao era (Bo liked to tweet Mao quotes at his followers). Neither Hu nor the Standing Committee as a whole had the gumption to stop Bo’s open campaigning for power.In February 2012, things went off the rails. Bo’s police chief, having fallen out with his patron and fearing for his personal safety, disguised himself and drove three hours to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu with information about the possible role of Bo’s wife in the murder of a British businessman. With the United States and Britain involved, the Party’s central leaders could no longer ignore the case, so they used it to bring Bo down. He was detained on suspicion of corruption, and his wife faced a murder charge. Both were eventually convicted and sentenced to life in prison. During Xi’s first term, he punished five other senior politicians for plotting to seize power under the spur of “burning personal ambition.”29Can Personalistic Rule Endure?The flagrant failures of collective leadership under Hu help us to understand why Xi was able to convince (or intimidate) other members of the CCP elite to go along with his return to strongman leadership. The post-Mao institutionalization of leadership politics had not proceeded far or deeply enough to prevent a leader as ambitious as Xi from restoring personalistic dictatorial rule. Certain norms and precedents were followed, but this minimal institutionalization failed to stop Xi from grasping power.Most authoritarian governments are brought down not by mass revolt, [End Page 33] but by internal leadership splits. According to political scientist Milan Svolik, two-thirds of the world’s authoritarian rulers deposed between 1946 and 2008 fell to elite insiders. He wrote positively of the stability achieved by institutionalized power-sharing in post-Mao China, but questioned whether it would be able to bind Xi Jinping as it did his predecessors.30Redistributing the spoils of power, as Xi is doing, generally leads to elite conflict. His power play could spark resistance from disappointed politicians who have lost their patronage and chances for promotion. The reaction could reach critical mass during Xi’s second term when Xi’s ambition to cling to power is out in the open. Chinese politicians value term limits and retirement rules as protection for their security against a leader who otherwise could ruin their careers at any time. Although the odds of success for an elite rebellion may be low, the more autocratically a leader behaves, the more likely other politicians are to try to bring him down. As Svolik observed, “The ladder to ultimate power becomes more slippery as the dictator advances to the top.”31 Today no one dares to talk publicly about Deng’s warnings against “overconcentration of power.” But Deng’s admonition provides a focal point for future elite resistance. The pendulum could swing back to institutionalized collective leadership, this time reinforced by a stronger legislature and legal system.The more repressive Xi’s regime becomes, however, the more reluctant he will be to leave the throne. He has made too many enemies. Xi’s cult of personality could also snap back against him. The political elite was ready to embrace a stronger leader, but not one who aspires to make himself an object of worship in the style of Mao Zedong or Kim Jong Un. Even if no one dares to challenge Xi, he will continue to suspect everyone because he has no way of knowing who is loyal and who is faking.Although an elite backlash against Xi could destabilize the system, an even greater risk to China, and to the world, is the poor decision making that may result from the excessive concentration of power in Beijing. Xi is unfettered domestically; he has grasped all the levers of power and surrounded himself with sycophants. Local officials who drag their feet in implementing policy must now face the Discipline Commission. Xi’s signature projects, including the set of hugely ambitious infrastructure projects known as the Belt and Road Initiative, are going forward in the style of Mao-era ideological campaigns—officials vie to show loyalty by pressing eagerly ahead with whatever scheme the leader happens to favor.In the world arena, meanwhile, the constraints on Xi are weakening amid declining U.S. credibility and influence. Xi’s ambition for global leadership and his explicit ideological and mercantilist challenge to market democracies are forms of overreaching that could lead to a new Cold War. What is more, arbitrary and imprudent decisions taken during a crisis involving the East or South China Seas, the Korean Peninsula, or Taiwan could escalate into a hot war. The risks posed by Xi’s over-concentrated [End Page 34] power are not confined within China’s borders, but extend to the world beyond.NOTES1.

All these moves were designed to decentralize authority, regularize political life and check dictatorial power. The centerpiece of the institutionalization project was the practice of regular peaceful leadership succession followed by Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Regular premortem leadership succession was a rare achievement in a communist system and the most important source of China’s “authoritarian resilience.” Yet today, Xi Jinping is taking China back to a personalistic dictatorship after decades of institutionalized collective leadership. He has clearly signaled his intention to remain in office after his normal two terms end in 2022. This article analyzes the reasons why the institutional rules and precedents laid down since Deng Xiaoping’s time failed to prevent the emergence of another strongman leader like Mao Zedong.\n\nAfter Mao Zedong died at the age of 82 in 1976, his successors deliberately crafted a system that they hoped would prevent the rise of another dictator. Mao had turned against other leaders and put the nation at risk through irrational schemes. Deng Xiaoping, Mao’s former comrade-in-arms who had twice been purged by him, did not blame Mao as an individual for the tragic mistakes of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) and the Great Leap Forward (1958–62). Instead, Deng targeted the systemic source of the problem: “Over-concentration of power is liable to give rise to arbitrary rule by individuals at the expense of collective leadership.”\n\nDeng and his colleagues introduced fixed terms of office, term limits, and a mandatory retirement age; delegated authority from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to government agencies under the State Council (the cabinet of the People’s Republic of China [PRC]); and started holding regular meetings of CCP institutions such as the Central Committee as well as the Politburo and its Standing Committee (the inner rings of power). All these moves were meant to decentralize authority, regularize political life, and check dictatorial power.\n\nThe centerpiece of the effort to prevent dictatorship and regularize political competition was the practice of peaceful leadership succession. Students of authoritarianism often identify leadership succession as its “Achilles heel”—a weak point that threatens regime stability by breeding power struggles and sclerotic leadership. When Jiang Zemin voluntarily retired from the post of CCP general secretary in 2002 (followed by his stepping down as president in 2003 and military chief in 2004), it was the first time that any ruler of a communist nation had left office without dying or being deposed by a coup. After Jiang, Hu Jintao served ten years in the three top offices, then voluntarily retired from all those positions in 2012 and 2013. Peaceful and regular premortem leadership succession has been a remarkable political achievement and the most important source of what Andrew Nathan has called China’s “authoritarian resilience.”\n\nYet today, after decades of collective leadership, Xi Jinping is taking China back to personalistic leadership. By the end of his first five-year term, Xi had consolidated greater personal power than Jiang or Hu had ever held. Xi broke precedent by not promoting a successor-in-training at the Nineteenth Party Congress in October 2017. And in March 2018 the National People’s Congress (or NPC, China’s legislature) changed the state constitution to abolish the two-term limit for the president—a clear sign that Xi is planning to stay on beyond 2023.\n\nChina in the twenty-first century is a vibrant modern economy and society open to the world, with a large and well-educated urban middle class. Many people inside and outside the country expected its political system to follow the historical example of other authoritarian regimes by gradually institutionalizing governance to make it more accountable, responsive, and law-bound. Until 2012, that is essentially what happened. But under Xi Jinping, China is making a U-turn. Personalistic rule is back.\n\nWhy have the institutional rules and precedents laid down since Deng Xiaoping’s time failed to prevent the rise of another Mao-like strongman, with all the risks that implies? In institutionalizing collective leadership after Mao, the CCP was taking the path followed earlier by communist parties in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Those parties adapted to suit the needs of economic and social modernization, but in the end they lost power and today are no more. Xi Jinping is determined to avert such a fate for the CCP, so he has turned in the opposite direction. His unexpected reversion to strongman rule suggests that the change from personalism to institutionalized collective leadership in authoritarian regimes is cyclical, not evolutionary.\n\nXi Jinping has grasped all the levers of power in the Party and the state (including the military and police). The Party has reclaimed the authority over economic policy that it delegated to the state starting in the 1980s. Echoing vintage-1962 Mao, the 2017 Party Congress declared that “East-West North-South the Party is leading everything.” The Leading Small Group on Comprehensively Deepening Reform, chaired by Xi with three other Politburo Standing Committee members as vice chairs, has become a more powerful shadow State Council, usually meeting monthly and issuing specific policies on a wide range of issues, including economic ones. Heads of government bodies now regularly report to the Politburo Standing Committee.\n\nWithin the Party, Xi acts as if he is personally in charge of everything. He chairs eight of the leading small groups including the National Security Commission. Xi also handles internal security directly, thereby reducing the chances of a coup.\n\nXi’s hold on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is even more complete than his hold on the CCP and the government. As Tai Ming Cheung has observed, “No other Chinese Communist Party leader, not even Mao Zedong, has controlled the military to the same extent as Xi does today. Mao had to share power with powerful revolutionary-era marshals.” To show how “hands-on” he is, Xi has taken the new post of commander-in-chief of the PLA Joint Battle Command. One officer told me that whereas generals administered the PLA under Hu, Xi runs it himself. The People’s Armed Police, responsible for putting down civil unrest, used to be under the joint control of the CCP Central Military Commission and the State Council. Now the Military Commission, headed by Xi, has sole charge of China’s paramilitary police.\n\nXi’s first term saw an unprecedented campaign against official corruption and Party indiscipline. Through this crackdown he cleaned up the CCP—and purged his rivals. As of late 2017, the CCP Central Discipline Commission had punished almost 1.4 million Party members. They included seventeen full and seventeen alternate Central Committee members, a pair of sitting Politburo members, an ex-member of the Politburo Standing Committee, and more than a hundred generals and admirals. The main goal, said Xi, was to restore public respect for the Party. It was a matter of “survival or extinction.” Xi has also begun using the Discipline Commission against local officials who fail to carry out top-down economic and environmental policies. As of 2018, a new body under Xi’s de facto control called the National Supervision Commission will press the campaign beyond Party members to everyone who works for the state or its affiliates. This will include professors, doctors, and executives of state-owned enterprises.\n\nThe crackdown gave Xi weapons to eliminate potential rivals, erase competing power centers, and'}, {'raw_text': 'China\'s Xi Jinping takes commander in chief military title- PublishedChina\'s President Xi Jinping has taken on a new military title, in his latest move to exert greater control over the armed forces.Mr Xi is now commander in chief of the military\'s Joint Operations Command Centre.State media showed him visiting the centre wearing camouflage fatigues.China\'s foreign policy has become increasingly assertive in recent years, especially on its claims to disputed territories in the South China Sea.Mr Xi is already General Secretary of the Communist Party, and chair of the Central Military Commission, which manages the People\'s Liberation Army.Correspondents say that, given Mr Xi\'s consolidation of power in China, the move will be interpreted by some as a propaganda message that he is now in absolute control.Analysis: John Sudworth, BBC News, BeijingAs Shakespeare once wrote, what\'s in a name?We probably shouldn\'t make too much of the new commander in chief title.

He has sought to raise the standard of living at home and China\'s power and influence around the world.Critics accuse him of consolidating power and creating a campaign of oppression.Nick Schifrin reports from Beijing on the strongest Chinese leader in more than 50 years.Nick Schifrin:In Beijing\'s Great Hall of the People, the people clap in unison for one man. Xi Jinping, Communist Party general-secretary, commander in chief, president of the People\'s Republic of China, says he\'s making China great again.President Xi Jinping (through translator):The Chinese nation has achieved a tremendous transformation. It has stood up, grown rich, and is becoming strong. It has come to embrace the brilliant prospects of rejuvenation.It\'s October 2017, and Xi tells party leaders one of his core beliefs, China\'s destiny is to reclaim a central role in the world.President Xi Jinping (through translator):The banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is now flying high and proud. It offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind.Not since Mao Zedong, communist China\'s founding father, has a Chinese leader suggested so clearly the world could emulate China. Not since Mao has China had a leader as powerful as Xi Jinping.If what the party leader says is the bible, the scholars who decipher it study here. The National Communist Party School flies the party flag and teaches the party\'s version of China, united across 55 minority groups, and the torchbearer of the communist flame.Professor Han Qingxiang says Xi inherits that legacy and is now China\'s indispensable leader.Han Qingxiang (through translator):The country\'s development needs Xi Jinping, and people\'s happiness needs Xi Jinping. If China wants to become a big, strong country, it will need Xi Jinping.Xi says his work starts at home. His goal is to double China\'s GDP and per capita income. He says he wants to increase the prosperity many Chinese already enjoy and now expect, and reduce poverty.Now, in the Xi Jinping era, China has developed. Xi is dealing with making China great and strong.And that strength is also the military. Xi calls for China to — quote — ""stand tall in the East."" He evokes memories of the Middle Kingdom, a term to describe China\'s centuries-long role as an international power.Xi has dramatically modernized China\'s army, Navy and Air Force, and opened up China\'s first overseas base. And, most controversially, China claims almost all of the South China Sea, and has created military outposts, flouting U.S. objections and international law.Xi Jinping\'s China flexes that muscular foreign policy on the world stage and the silver screen. ""Wolf Warrior 2"" is China\'s highest-grossing film of all time. Star and director Wu Jing plays Leng Feng, a special operations forces soldier who wins the day for the Chinese military.When he\'s no longer a soldier, trouble comes to him. He becomes a rogue hero, launching a seeming suicide mission against the bad guys and teaming up with fellow Chinese to save the day again.If a story about a former-soldier-turned-vigilante who uses bows and arrows and takes a ride in a tank sounds familiar, it is. At the height of the Cold War, the U.S. had John Rambo.Wu Jing asks, why can\'t the Chinese have their own heroes?Wu Jing (through translator):I think, for Leng Feng, I want him to be a hero for ordinary people. I think human beings need heroes. There are many qualities in a hero, like bravery, selflessness, and dedication.Actor:Pass me the flag.It\'s more than dedication to China. The good guys are the Chinese military.The bad guy…Welcome to Africa, son.… is a violence-loving colonialist American.People like you will always be inferior to people like me.Wu Jing:That\'s (EXPLETIVE DELETED) history.The film has made Wu Jing rich and famous. He says the film\'s nationalism is a product of the country\'s progress under Xi Jinping.Wu Jing (through translator):In Chinese modern history, China has been bullied for a long time. When we are rich, our country can protect us. When we feel like when we are in danger, we will be protected by our country, not like before.But Xi Jinping isn\'t only about protecting the people. He protects and restores the prominence of the Communist Party.Xi has reasserted the party into people\'s lives and private businesses.Can you describe these awards?Hong Cheng works for the medical and high-tech company Tidal Star, but her main job is to lead the company\'s Communist Party committee. She shows off her party awards.Hong Cheng (through translator):This is for one of the service brands we acquired being in the top 10 of all service brands.Employees meet in Tidal Star\'s party room, where Xi Jinping thought is written on the wall, and Hong ensures this private company adheres to party teaching.Hong Cheng (through translator):Today, we\'re going to study an article. Please open the app Study Xi Strengthen China.Under Xi, the party\'s primacy has increased, and targeted the youngest party members. Employees are encouraged by the company to use the Study Xi Strengthen China app to read about Xi and party leaders and take quizzes.And Hong ensures the company\'s vision aligns with the party\'s.It not only leads our company in long-term development. The app offers our company inspiration.For a while, that inspiration came from Xi himself. Last year, there was a prime-time TV show studying Xi in the new eraA robot from a future rejuvenated China challenges contestants on how much Xi Jinping thought they can memorize. The cult of Xi has included propaganda posters in city streets, suburban villages and rural roads. And state media has called him Xi Dada, or Father Xi, a populist who eats like the people and cares about the common worker.Xi calls himself Core Leader, just like Mao. And Xi\'s travels recreate Mao\'s countryside visits.This year, the cult of Xi has become less visible. But in Beijing\'s largest bookstore, ""Xi Jinping Thought,"" the book, has pride of place. Despite the American celebrities nearby, bookstore manager Qin Hui says Xi\'s books are bestsellers.Qin Hui (through translator):Because we\'re entering this new era of development, the General-Secretary Xi\'s ""Thought"" points a direction for our future. So we have to seriously study the spirit of General-Secretary Xi\'s speeches.But fly 1,200 miles south of Beijing, and hundreds of thousands of people reject ""Xi Jinping Thought"" and everything it stands for.Xi Jinping\'s critics say he\'s not only spreading his own ideas; he\'s closing the space for anyone else\'s ideas, both in mainland China and here in Hong Kong, where these protesters say they feel like the city\'s independence is being eroded.On and off for months, Hong Kong police have clashed with protesters, and many of the protesters connect the crackdown in Hong Kong to the restriction of rights in mainland China.Lee Cheuk-Yan:How can we expect that we will have democracy, when the Communist Party is trying to ban all human rights and freedom in China?Lee Cheuk-Yan is a former Hong Kong legislator who\'s been fighting for democracy for decades. He\'s protested half-a-dozen Chinese leaders, but says Xi Jinping is the most oppressive.Xi Jinping began to — even more aggressive in suppression. They banned the university professor from teaching about human rights, universal values. And he is trying to, you know, build up his own Chinese dream, which is a total control of people.Under Xi, more than a million Muslim Uyghurs have been detained in camps. Xi\'s China has created a network of more than 200 million surveillance cameras.And Beijing posters have warned the public, especially women, that foreigners could be spies trying to steal national secrets.And what the party says is that this is for the strength of China, that, if the party were to weaken, the country would weaken, and there would be chaos.Yes, they are always brainwashing the people that, you know, without a Communist Party, there would be chaos.So what they are trying to say, if you have democracy, then there will be chaos.We believe in democracy, but they believe in suppression.Inside mainland China, few critics are willing to echo that language in public. Zhang Lifan is a historian who\'s made public appearances, but he says surveillance has increased.So, we met him in the only place he felt comfortable, inside our hotel room. He wouldn\'t use Xi Jinping\'s name.Zhang Lifan (through translator):Because the Communist Party of China is unchecked, corruption is widespread within the system.So if he wants to get rid of opponents, he can easily do so by finding evidence of their corruption. Therefore, he was able to purge many political opponents with an unstoppable force.Lifan says Xi\'s eyes are everywhere. Lawyers who have represented activists have been disbarred. Journalists who write critically have been thrown out of the country.And as many as two million party members have been investigated for corruption. Xi has replaced collective leadership with centralized authority.Zhang Lifan (through translator):The current leader has changed everything. He first canceled the term limit of the country\'s presidency, and then re-raised the idea that the party leads everything. As a result, some of the achievements of the political reforms of the 1980s no longer exist.Xi\'s reversing those reforms launched by predecessor Deng Xiaoping is a topic even Xi\'s allies avoid.Deng talked about there shouldn\'t excessive concentration or leadership by one person. Xi has removed term limits. Why has he done that?This is not a problem yet. Not the right time to talk about it.Why are the needs of the country so great that Xi Jinping needs more time?It\'s not the time to answer this question.And then he says to our off-camera government minder:Han Qingxiang (through translator):This is a very sensitive issue.(LAUGHTER)Xi and China face headwinds both home and abroad. But for the first time in modern history, the U.S. is confronted with an increasingly assertive rising superpower that\'s integrated with the U.S. economy.And as the U.S. puts America first, China is led by a man who believes the future of the world has China at the center.For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I\'m Nick Schifrin in Beijing.Watch the Full EpisodeNick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Correspondent.

He has sought to raise the standard of living at home, while boosting China’s power and influence across the globe. But critics accuse him of consolidating power and creating a campaign of oppression against the Chinese people -- especially those who disagree with him. Nick Schifrin reports from Beijing.\n\nTonight, we launch our series ""China: Power & Prosperity. ""With the support of the Pulitzer Center, correspondents Nick Schifrin and Katrina Yu and producers Dan Sagalyn and Eric O\'Connor conducted more than 70 on-camera interviews, traveled to eight Chinese cities, and reported from or collaborated with producers in eight countries, to cover everything from trade, to technology, to the lifestyles of the young and rich.\n\nWe begin our series at the top.\nChinese President Xi Jinping\'s philosophy has been written into the country\'s constitution. He has sought to raise the standard of living at home and China\'s power and influence around the world.\n\nCritics accuse him of consolidating power and creating a campaign of oppression.\nIn Beijing\'s Great Hall of the People, the people clap in unison for one man. Xi Jinping, Communist Party general-secretary, commander in chief, president of the People\'s Republic of China, says he\'s making China great again.\n\nThe Chinese nation has achieved a tremendous transformation. It has stood up, grown rich, and is becoming strong. It has come to embrace the brilliant prospects of rejuvenation.\n\nIt\'s October 2017, and Xi tells party leaders one of his core beliefs, China\'s destiny is to reclaim a central role in the world.\nThe banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is now flying high and proud. It offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind.\n\nNot since Mao Zedong, communist China\'s founding father, has a Chinese leader suggested so clearly the world could emulate China. Not since Mao has China had a leader as powerful as Xi Jinping.\n\nIf what the party leader says is the bible, the scholars who decipher it study here. The National Communist Party School flies the party flag and teaches the party\'s version of China, united across 55 minority groups, and the torchbearer of the communist flame.\n\nProfessor Han Qingxiang says Xi inherits that legacy and is now China\'s indispensable leader.\nThe country\'s development needs Xi Jinping, and people\'s happiness needs Xi Jinping. If China wants to become a big, strong country, it will need Xi Jinping.\n\nXi says his work starts at home. His goal is to double China\'s GDP and per capita income. He says he wants to increase the prosperity many Chinese already enjoy and now expect, and reduce poverty.\n\nNow, in the Xi Jinping era, China has developed. Xi is dealing with making China great and strong.\n\nAnd that strength is also the military. Xi calls for China to — quote — ""stand tall in the East."" He evokes memories of the Middle Kingdom, a term to describe China\'s centuries-long role as an international power.\n\nXi has dramatically modernized China\'s army, Navy and Air Force, and opened up China\'s first overseas base. And, most controversially, China claims almost all of the South China Sea, and has created military outposts, flouting U.S. objections and international law.\n\nXi Jinping\'s China flexes that muscular foreign policy on the world stage and the silver screen. ""Wolf Warrior 2"" is China\'s highest-grossing film of all time. Star and director Wu Jing plays Leng Feng, a special operations forces soldier who wins the day for the Chinese military.\n\nWhen he\'s no longer a soldier, trouble comes to him. He becomes a rogue hero, launching a seeming suicide mission against the bad guys and teaming up with fellow Chinese to save the day again.\n\nIf a story about a former-soldier-turned-vigilante who uses bows and arrows and takes a ride in a tank sounds familiar, it is. At the height of the Cold War, the U.S. had John Rambo.\n\nWu Jing asks, why can\'t the Chinese have their own heroes?\nI think, for Leng Feng, I want him to be a hero for ordinary people. I think human beings need heroes. There are many qualities in a hero, like bravery, selflessness, and dedication.\n\nIt\'s more than dedication to China. The good guys are the Chinese military.\n\nThe bad guy…Welcome to Africa, son.… is a violence-loving colonialist American.\nPeople like you will always be inferior to people like me.\nThat\'s (EXPLETIVE DELETED) history.\nThe film has made Wu Jing rich and famous. He says the film\'s nationalism is a product of the country\'s progress under Xi Jinping.\n\nIn Chinese modern history, China has been bullied for a long time. When we are rich, our country can protect us. When we feel like when we are in danger, we will be protected by our country, not like before.\n\nBut Xi Jinping isn\'t only about protecting the people. He protects and restores the prominence of the Communist Party.\n\nXi has reasserted the party into people\'s lives and private businesses.\nCan you describe these awards?\nThis is for one of the service brands we acquired being in the top 10 of all service brands.\nToday, we\'re going to study an article. Please open the app Study Xi Strengthen China.\n\nUnder Xi, the party\'s primacy has increased, and targeted the youngest party members. Employees are encouraged by the company to use the Study Xi Strengthen China app to read about Xi and party leaders and take quizzes.\n\nAnd Hong ensures the company\'s vision aligns with the party\'s.\nIt not only leads our company in long-term development. The app offers our company inspiration.\n\nFor a while, that inspiration came from Xi himself. Last year, there was a prime-time TV show studying Xi in the new era\n\nA robot from a future rejuvenated China challenges contestants on how much Xi Jinping thought they can memorize. The cult of Xi has included propaganda posters in city streets, suburban villages and rural roads. And state media has called him Xi Dada, or Father Xi, a populist who eats like the people and cares about the common worker.\n\nXi calls himself Core Leader, just like Mao. And Xi\'s travels recreate Mao\'s countryside visits.\n\nThis year, the cult of Xi has become less visible. But in Beijing\'s largest bookstore, ""Xi Jinping Thought,"" the book, has pride of place. Despite the American celebrities nearby, bookstore manager Qin Hui says Xi\'s books are bestsellers.\n\nBecause we\'re entering this new era of development, the General-Secretary Xi\'s ""Thought"" points a direction for our future. So we have to seriously study the spirit of General-Secretary Xi\'s speeches.\n\nBut fly 1,200 miles south of Beijing, and hundreds of thousands of people reject ""Xi Jinping Thought"" and everything it stands for.\nXi Jinping\'s critics say he\'s not only spreading his own ideas; he\'s closing the space for anyone else\'s ideas, both in mainland China and here in Hong Kong, where these protesters s'}]","The fundamental difference is allegiance. The U.S. President, as Commander in Chief, leads armed forces loyal to the Constitution, operating under a system of civilian control with congressional oversight.

In contrast, Xi Jinping’s authority stems from his position as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. The People's Liberation Army (PLA), with its **approximately two million active-duty personnel**, is not a national army but the armed wing of the Party.

As the **Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) notes**, the PLA's primary role is to ensure the CCP's survival. This is why China expert Andrew Scobell states, **“The PLA is the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party, not of the Chinese state.”** This structure centralizes military power under the Party, and by extension, Xi Jinping, without the institutional checks and balances found in the U.S. system."
